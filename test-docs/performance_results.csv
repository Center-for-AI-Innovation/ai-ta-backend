"How do I code this: The Problem
You will be completing a program that prints out your name and age to stdout. All the code you write will go in hello.cpp

TODO:

Create a variable to hold your age
Create a variable to hold your name
Initialize the values of these two variables
Write a function hello that takes no arguments and returns a std::string containing the following text: ""Hello world! My name is your_name and I am your_age years old."" where your_name and your_age are the values of your name and age variables.
The autograder is not that smart. It will be reasonably accommodating about your name, accept any integer for an age, but the rest of the text must match exactly.

In C++, text is stored in a string type. We haven't gone over that in class yet, but a quick Google search should enlighten you on how to use it.

Testing Your Code
Run the following commands to compile and execute your code:

make
./main
Sample Output
Let's say your name is Jared, and you're 19 years old. When you run ./main, you should see the following:

Hello world! My name is Jared and I am 19 years old.",0.114431748,0.208543659,0.194121491,0.069118725,0.083524091,0.084172866,0.344196638,4.72937627,3.656317215,3.093627321,1.101247609,3.122720731,4.225278089,3.139633652
"The Problem
You will be writing a program that outputs the amount of time that has passed since Epoch. (Googling Epoch may help)

Write a program that prints out the time that has passed since the Epoch in 1) hours, 2) days, and 3) years, (ignoring leap years, so each year is 365 days) each on a separate line. Integer division is acceptable.

To do this, you will write three functions: int hours(time_t t), int days(time_t t), and int years(time_t t). These functions all take the time since the epoch as input.

The time_t type is used to hold the number of seconds since the epoch; its actual type (int, long, etc.) depends on your system and compiler. You can read more about it here on cppreference.com.

In the provided code, you will find a variable that contains the seconds since epoch called sec_since_epoch.

Testing Your Code
Run the following commands to compile and execute your code:

make
./main

"For RGBToGrayscaleConversion, should we use 8×8, 16×16 or
32×32 blocks? Assume the GPU can have 1,536 threads per SM and up to
8 blocks per SM.
– For 8×8, we have 64 threads per block. Each SM can take up to 1,536 threads,
which is 1,536/64=24 blocks. But each SM can only take up to 8 Blocks, so only
512 threads (16 warps) go into each SM!
– For 16×16, we have 256 threads per block. Each SM can take up to 1,536 threads
(48 warps), which is 6 blocks (within the 8 block limit). Thus, we use the full
thread capacity of an SM.
– For 32×32, we have 1,024 threads per Block. Only one block can fit into an SM,
using only 2/3 of the thread capacity of an SM.",0.111107127,0.222795237,0.138559125,0.070477616,0.071173675,0.082011518,0.343127144,4.627291534,1.481013987,3.059129789,1.032133324,1.068803626,4.121993007,1.084636384
