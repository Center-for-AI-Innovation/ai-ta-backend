    "Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is a representation for 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. Despite some recent work showing preliminary success in editing a reconstructed NeRF with diffusion prior, they remain struggling to synthesize reasonable geometry in completely uncovered regions. One major reason is the high diversity of synthetic contents from the diffusion model, which hinders the radiance field from converging to a crisp and deterministic geometry. Moreover, applying latent diffusion models on real data often yields a textural shift incoherent to the image condition due to auto-encoding errors. These two problems are further reinforced with the use of pixel-distance losses. To address these issues, we propose tempering the diffusion model's stochasticity with per-scene customization and mitigating the textural shift with masked adversarial training. During the analyses, we also found the commonly used pixel and perceptual losses are harmful in the NeRF inpainting task. Through rigorous experiments, our framework yields state-of-the-art NeRF inpainting results on various real-world scenes.\n",

    "1Introduction\n",
    "The recent advancements in neural radiance fields (NeRF) [24, 27, 3] have achieved high-quality 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis of scenes captured with a collection of images. The success intrigues an increasing attention on manipulating NeRFs such as 3D scene stylization [38, 8] and NeRF editing [13]. In this work, we focus on the NeRF inpainting problem. As shown in Figure 1, given a set of images of a scene with the inpainting masks, our goal is to estimate a completed NeRF that renders high-quality images at novel viewpoints. The NeRF inpainting task enables a variety of 3D content creation applications such as removing objects from a scene [26, 39], completing non-observed part of the scene, and hallucinating contents in the designated regions.\n",
