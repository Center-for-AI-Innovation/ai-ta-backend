Gies’ MBA – known as the iMBA – is a full 72-credit-hour MBA offered completely online and at a price point that is almost unheard of anywhere else in the world.Fully embracing the University of Illinois’ original land-grant mission, Gies Business is committed to creating life-changing access to business education. Launched in 2016,  the iMBA\\xa0was the world’s first fully online MBA that was designed specifically with the online learner in mind and offered at a market-shattering price. Because the iMBA is flexible and costs approximately $23K, the majority of learners can continue to work full-time without accruing the massive debt often associated with an MBA degree, which can range from $70K to $200K. In addition, there is no on-campus requirement, and learners can pay for each course individually as they take them, instead of paying for an entire semester up front.The iMBA has grown to include more than 4,000 learners living in more than 100 countries. Course material is delivered in a way that mirrors how learners will actually use it on the job, which has helped 61 percent of iMBA students earn a promotion, job offer, or new position during their time in the program, and learner satisfaction sits at an astonishing 96 percent. In 2020, the iMBA was named Poets&Quants’ #1 Biggest B-School Innovation of the Decade.\"Gies has taken a truly innovative approach to business education. You won’t find another MBA program that is more affordable, more accessible, and more innovative,\" said John Byrne,\\xa0Poets&Quants\\'\\xa0founder and editor-in-chief. \"What impresses me most is how Gies’ stackable model has created different on-ramps into the degree; it’s unlike any other program, and it really is the future of higher education.\"“When I started looking at MBA programs, I knew with my work and family responsibilities that I would need an affordable and flexible program,” said Condola King, a 2022 graduate. “I knew the iMBA would be an outstanding academic experience, but I hadn’t anticipated how connected and engaged I would feel learning from my living room. I was taught by exceptional faculty and surrounded by enthusiastic and amazing people who supported me.”In an unprecedented move, Gies made its entire portfolio of online offerings compatible – or “stackable” – with each other, allowing learners to start small and add to their educational journey piece by piece without retaking courses or paying unnecessary tuition. In Fall 2022, the College announced that graduates of its online Master of Science in Management (iMSM)\\xa0and Master of Science in Accountancy (iMSA)\\xa0can apply the 36 hours it takes to complete those degrees toward the 72-credit-hour MBA degree. Gies also launched three online graduate certificates\\xa0in Digital Marketing, Accounting Data Analytics, and Strategic Leadership & Management. Learners can complete each of these in four-to-eight months, earning credit that can be applied toward any of its three online degree programs.“This year, we once again took business education to the next level by making our entire portfolio of courses stackable,” said Jeffrey R. Brown, Josef and Margot Lakonishok Professor in Business and dean at Gies. “Learners can start by taking a single online course, add others to complete a certificate, and ultimately turn that certificate into one or more business degrees. This creates flexibility on an unprecedented scale.”“We’re serving up the degree in manageable bits, creating certificates for core areas and opening multiple pathways into an MBA,” said Brooke Elliott, EY Professor and executive associate dean at Gies. “This highly flexible approach is proving to be incredibly attractive to people who may not be ready to commit to a graduate business degree but want the specialized knowledge that can advance their career, and it creates multiple convenient entryways into graduate education.”The Gies iMBA also offers a number of opportunities to gain additional experience through optional micro-immersions in the US and week-long global immersions that focus on business and economics in host countries.“Our goal is to break down any and all barriers to learning skills to become a successful business leader,” Brown said. “Where you live, how much money is in your bank account, or what undergraduate degree you earned shouldn’t matter. We’re proud that Gies levels the playing field for anyone who’s ready to work hard and work with our world-class faculty and curious learners from the smallest towns and biggest cities around the world.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore Articles\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHOW ALL NEWS\\n   \\n  ',\n",

You can apply directly to a graduate degree, inquire about our Performance-based Admissions Track (PAT), enroll in a for-credit course, or sign up for one of two non-credit options.\\nYou don’t have to apply to a degree program to take for-credit courses or to enroll in noncredit classes and certificate programs. They’re all available as stand-alone options. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDegree Access PointsTake noncredit courses individually or toward certificationEnroll in a for-credit course individuallyApply to a graduate certificate programApply to the Performance-based Admissions Track (PAT)Apply to a degree program\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOption 1Take noncredit courses individually or toward certificationSelf-directed, noncredit courses are the basic building block of your degree. Each of these noncredit courses serves\\n    as the first segment of a corresponding for-credit course. The noncredit segment provides foundational material\\n    for the for-credit segment.You can take just the self-directed, noncredit courses for free if you don’t plan to go on to a degree program, advanced graduate-level work, or earn a noncredit certificate.\\n If you just want some foundational knowledge, you’ll find that the on-demand classes are great resources and will likely have immediate applicability in your work. Once you complete the noncredit segment, you can:Earn a noncredit certificate for a single course if you don’t want to go onto the graduate level by paying a membership fee. \\nEarn a noncredit specialization certificate. You would take a prescribed sequence of noncredit courses by paying a membership fee.     If you only want to read and view the course content, you can audit the course for free.  You’re welcome to complete a full    \\n\\n    noncredit business specialization now and build it into a for-credit specialization over time.\\nEnroll in the for-credit portion of the class by applying and paying tuition.\\n\\n\\nWhy enroll in a noncredit course?There are three reasons you might want to enroll in a noncredit course:If you intend to go onto the for-credit course or a full degree and want to get a head start.If you just want to take the foundational free content and not go further.If you want to earn a certificate in a business specialization but not a full degree.How do I get started?Noncredit courses and specializations are offered in accounting, finance, digital marketing, management, and more.\\xa0The self-directed segments of our classes are delivered through the website of our partner, Coursera.View Noncredit CoursesView Noncredit Specializations\\n\\nOption 2Enroll in a for-credit course individually Taking for-credit courses as a non-degree student is a great way to demonstrate your readiness for a degree program, and to determine if the degree program is the right fit for you. Graduate-level, for-credit courses start at various times throughout the year. They deliver content that can make an immediate impact in your work, and credits can be applied toward your degree (or transferred to other universities).\\n\\n\\nWhy enroll in a for-credit course?There are three reasons you may want to enroll in a for-credit course as a non-degree student:You are planning to apply to an online degree program or are in the process of applying. You want to get a head start on your coursework or take a first course as a way to ease back into being a student.You are interested in a specific subject area or specialization and not a full degree program. You can take just the classes that peak your interest with a shorter time and commitment.You want to earn academic credit for transfer to another program or university. Credits earned are full University of Illinois credits, but be sure to check with your home institution.How do I get started?You will go through a short application process to become a non-degree student.\\xa0 You will be onboarded into the program and will then register for courses.Courses are comprised of two parts: foundational content through Coursera and high-engagement content through the Illinois platform (Canvas).\\xa0 These two parts are designed to be completed together.Application InstructionsTo apply, please complete an application through the University of Illinois Graduate College. Use the following information on your application:Program:\\xa0Accountancy (iMSA) or Business Administration (iMBA, iMSM)Degree: iMBA, iMSA, or iMSM Non-Degree ProgramNon-Degree Track: Non-Degree General\\n\\nOption 3Apply to a Graduate CertificateIf you're not quite ready for a master's degree, you can enroll in a for-credit Graduate Certificate. These 12-credit-hour certificates are built around specific skills or competencies. Once complete, each certificate can be stacked into any of our online graduate degrees.\\xa0\\n\\nView Graduate Certificates\\xa0›\\n\\n\\nOption 4Apply to the Performance-based Admissions Track (PAT)If you're concerned that your profile might not be strong enough to gain admission to one of our online degree programs, the Performance-based Admissions Track (PAT) could be a good fit.

The course load is flexible – you can take one or two courses, or skip a term on your capacity.\\n\\n\\n\\nAre classes synchronous or asynchronous?\\nEach iMBA course has two structural components. One component is the self-directed, asynchronous part of the course, which will help you develop the baseline, foundational knowledge.  That material comes in the form of pre-recorded videos, which you can watch at your convenience, as well as complementary readings.  The second component is what we call the high engagement part of the course. This is an additional layer that goes on top of the foundational, baseline knowledge. It is an expansion of the depth and the breadth of the first set of materials. It involves weekly live sessions, where you will be in a virtual classroom with faculty and your classmates.  Faculty will be presenting additional materials or case analysis. During the live sessions you will have the opportunity to ask questions, and to present your work, either individually or as a group.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\nApply to the iMBA Program Today Apply NowRequest Information   \\n  \",\n",

The course load is flexible – you can take one or two courses, or skip a term on your capacity.\\n\\n\\n\\nWill I be eligible to sit for the Uniform CPA exam after I complete the iMSA?\\nThe University of Illinois has not made a determination as to whether the iMSA program satisfies the academic prerequisites for the CPA exam and licensure in all 55 U.S. jurisdictions. \\xa0 While the AACSB accredited iMSA program will help you meet the education requirement to sit for the CPA exam, specific requirements to be eligible to take the exam and requirements to become a licensed CPA vary from state to state. In some cases, you may need to take additional coursework or exams to meet individual state requirements and/or you may need to complete background checks to take the CPA exam.\\xa0Please review the requirements issued by the Board of Accountancy in your state prior to applying to the iMSA program. Visit the\\xa0NASBA website\\xa0for the contact information and a listing of statutes for the State Board of Accountancy in each of the 55 jurisdictions, or the\\xa0AICPA website\\xa0to find your state’s CPA resources and contact information. Becoming a certified public accountant, or CPA, carries numerous benefits such as opportunities to increase your authority and responsibility, and, typically, your salary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\nApply to the iMSA Program Today Apply NowRequest Information   \\n  \"}"

Gies’ MBA – known as the iMBA – is a full 72-credit-hour MBA offered completely online and at a price point that is almost unheard of anywhere else in the world.Fully embracing the University of Illinois’ original land-grant mission, Gies Business is committed to creating life-changing access to business education. Launched in 2016,  the iMBA\\xa0was the world’s first fully online MBA that was designed specifically with the online learner in mind and offered at a market-shattering price. Because the iMBA is flexible and costs approximately $23K, the majority of learners can continue to work full-time without accruing the massive debt often associated with an MBA degree, which can range from $70K to $200K. In addition, there is no on-campus requirement, and learners can pay for each course individually as they take them, instead of paying for an entire semester up front.The iMBA has grown to include more than 4,000 learners living in more than 100 countries. Course material is delivered in a way that mirrors how learners will actually use it on the job, which has helped 61 percent of iMBA students earn a promotion, job offer, or new position during their time in the program, and learner satisfaction sits at an astonishing 96 percent. In 2020, the iMBA was named Poets&Quants’ #1 Biggest B-School Innovation of the Decade.\"Gies has taken a truly innovative approach to business education. You won’t find another MBA program that is more affordable, more accessible, and more innovative,\" said John Byrne,\\xa0Poets&Quants\\'\\xa0founder and editor-in-chief. \"What impresses me most is how Gies’ stackable model has created different on-ramps into the degree; it’s unlike any other program, and it really is the future of higher education.\"“When I started looking at MBA programs, I knew with my work and family responsibilities that I would need an affordable and flexible program,” said Condola King, a 2022 graduate. “I knew the iMBA would be an outstanding academic experience, but I hadn’t anticipated how connected and engaged I would feel learning from my living room. I was taught by exceptional faculty and surrounded by enthusiastic and amazing people who supported me.”In an unprecedented move, Gies made its entire portfolio of online offerings compatible – or “stackable” – with each other, allowing learners to start small and add to their educational journey piece by piece without retaking courses or paying unnecessary tuition. In Fall 2022, the College announced that graduates of its online Master of Science in Management (iMSM)\\xa0and Master of Science in Accountancy (iMSA)\\xa0can apply the 36 hours it takes to complete those degrees toward the 72-credit-hour MBA degree. Gies also launched three online graduate certificates\\xa0in Digital Marketing, Accounting Data Analytics, and Strategic Leadership & Management. Learners can complete each of these in four-to-eight months, earning credit that can be applied toward any of its three online degree programs.“This year, we once again took business education to the next level by making our entire portfolio of courses stackable,” said Jeffrey R. Brown, Josef and Margot Lakonishok Professor in Business and dean at Gies. “Learners can start by taking a single online course, add others to complete a certificate, and ultimately turn that certificate into one or more business degrees. This creates flexibility on an unprecedented scale.”“We’re serving up the degree in manageable bits, creating certificates for core areas and opening multiple pathways into an MBA,” said Brooke Elliott, EY Professor and executive associate dean at Gies. “This highly flexible approach is proving to be incredibly attractive to people who may not be ready to commit to a graduate business degree but want the specialized knowledge that can advance their career, and it creates multiple convenient entryways into graduate education.”The Gies iMBA also offers a number of opportunities to gain additional experience through optional micro-immersions in the US and week-long global immersions that focus on business and economics in host countries.“Our goal is to break down any and all barriers to learning skills to become a successful business leader,” Brown said. “Where you live, how much money is in your bank account, or what undergraduate degree you earned shouldn’t matter. We’re proud that Gies levels the playing field for anyone who’s ready to work hard and work with our world-class faculty and curious learners from the smallest towns and biggest cities around the world.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore Articles\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n            ',\n",

The Disruption Lab is here to cultivate those leaders.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere, students, faculty, and partners engage to explore disruptive forces and use a bold, imaginative approach to advance new ideas. We’re combining a disruptive thinking framework and early exposure to emerging technologies to solve tomorrow’s problems.With the support of founding partner Ernst & Young LLP (EY US), we present students with a transformational opportunity to think differently and challenge the status quo. EY’s purpose—to build a better working world – is evident in the importance they place on succeeding through disruption, making them natural partners.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWe accelerate the learning curve.Disruptive forces such as emerging technology, social activism, political instability, health outbreaks, and natural disasters all threaten the viability of businesses and turn the status quo on its head. Business leaders must not only prepare for disruption, but also develop innovative ways of thinking to succeed through rapid change.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe offer students early opportunities to explore breakthrough technologies, such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, augmented reality, blockchain, and more. Through Lab projects, students collaborate in interdisciplinary teams to deliver a viable product that has future application, adding an entrepreneurial dimension to their learning.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nSolving tomorrow's problems todayThe Lab gives companies a chance to tap into some of the brightest minds the University of Illinois has to offer as well as teach those students about the challenges and opportunities for disruption in their own industries.Connecting industry partners with innovative student minds and new ways of thinking allows participating organizations the opportunity to share their expertise with students and, perhaps in the process, gain a new perspective on the forces disrupting their industries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResearch that brings business and technology togetherThe wealth of information available today has fundamentally changed our world.

It is the first research study to examine the interaction between a platform’s ranking design and its incentive to manipulate product attractiveness. Fei Long, assistant professor of marketing at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, co-authored the paper, which has been accepted for publication by Marketing Science. “We used game theory methodology to disentangle the complexity of the platform, separating it into the moves made by the company, seller and consumers. By using this theoretical model, we can clearly see who is causing the trouble,” said Liu (left).The study, which focused on Amazon but can be applied to other retail marketplaces, shows these platforms use several manipulative tactics. For example, Amazon can charge sellers a premium for a top-ranked “Sponsored,” “Best Seller,” or “Amazon Choice” position, or buy blocks of favorable reviews to make an inferior product appear more attractive. China’s Taobao and Alibaba have long been accused of encouraging “brushing,” a deceitful technique that boosts a seller’s ratings by creating fake orders that are shipped to an accomplice or unsuspecting consumer in another country.For example, a seller may create a fake order with a tracking number for an expensive product. The consumer will receive an inexpensive item instead, but the platform will show it as a sale. This boosts the seller’s volume and ranking. In 2020, one such scam that originated in China became known as the “seeds of terror” because it involved sending consumers around the world packages that were labeled as jewelry, but actually contained mustard, cabbage, and hibiscus seeds. “These platforms provide so much convenience, but they are turning into ‘axes of evil’,” said Liu. “Consumers can no longer count on rank order, reviews, and recommendations to reflect a product’s true popularity and quality.”Lui said retail platforms are unlikely to change these practices on their own because they make more money by keeping them in place. For example, Amazon can charge one seller for a “Sponsored” slot, putting them in the number one position, and charge another for a “Recommended” position immediately below it. Those two sellers may then look for another advantage by lowering the price, which in turn drives sales—with Amazon pocketing anywhere from 8% to 15% in seller fees.“To date, government oversight is focused primarily on the national data security of these platforms, particularly those that are based in China,” said Liu. “This research provides a roadmap for how public policy makers and lawmakers can expand their scope to address the welfare of the millions of buyers and sellers who use these retail platforms.” The solutions won’t be simple. Liu believes public policies such as simply banning fake sales and fake reviews by third-party sellers may not necessarily eradicate manipulation on the platform, especially if they ignore the platform’s incentive to do so in the first place.“The debate is becoming more intense, and people are paying more attention, but this issue needs more visibility with those who can effect change,” said Liu. “In our next phase of the study we’ll look at how these retail marketplaces are manipulating their platforms to promote their own brands.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore Articles\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n            ',\n",

Our Purpose Statement, Commitments, and Beliefs define who we are, and they guide our decisions every day.Purpose.Gies Business shapes purposeful leaders through life-changing access to education, research and innovation.Commitments.Expand ACCESS to world-class business education, transforming lives in an inclusive culture where all are seen, heard, and valued.Foster EXCELLENCE in scholarship and teaching, which provides value for business and society and delivers educational opportunities at all stages in the learner journey.Fuel INNOVATION through a diverse, engaged community that’s inspired to discover new ways to do business and new ways to teach business.INCLUSION permeates all of our commitments and everything we do. Inclusion is essential for our scholars, learners, teachers, and leaders to thrive.Facilitate meaningful life-long ENGAGEMENT with the Gies Community in our pursuit of a shared purpose.Beliefs.Common HumanityWe believe in honoring every person with dignity and respect and creating space for authenticity and opportunity.Inclusive BelongingWe believe in building meaningful connections with empathy and fostering a community where all feel seen, heard, and valued.Purposeful InnovationWe believe in celebrating curiosity, challenging assumptions, and pushing boundaries to lead and model what’s next.Perpetual LearningWe believe learning and scholarship are ongoing pursuits that enrich individuals, organizations, and our community.Meaningful WorkWe believe in pursuing purpose and fulfillment to make work matter—for the betterment of ourselves and others.\\n\\n\\nDiversity, Equity & InclusionGies Business is committed to being a model for a diverse, equitable and inclusive community, being actively anti-racist, helping the next generation of business leaders do the same, and engaging the public and our corporate partners in these efforts. This commitment must be reflected among our students, within all aspects of our student and faculty recruiting efforts, and in our overall culture of discourse and community. Our Gies community stands united in recognizing the importance of these issues, and through the lens of our Business on Purpose mindset, each of us will be intentional about our work in this important area. While we acknowledge that we don’t have all the answers, we’re on this journey together. We can – and must – do better.Significant positive change requires careful planning, leadership, resources, and coordination. We have charged a steering committee and four associated working groups to make tangible recommendations about how our College can become a better leader in diversity, equity, anti-racism, and inclusion. After consulting widely with appropriate stakeholders, the steering committee will identify priorities and incorporate those into Gies’ strategic plans; direct investments to put initiatives on a path to success; ensure we are accountable and measure our progress; and transparently communicate the plans to our broader community.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMeet Dean Jeffrey BrownGies Business is a place to launch a fulfilling career and a place to spark the ideas that transform industries across the globe.\\nDEAN BROWN'S BIO\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nAdd Contact Information\\xa0\\n   \\n            \",\n",

We don't talk about mission, vision, and values in a traditional sense; instead, we encourage our learners, faculty, and staff think about who we are, why we exist, and how we work to achieve our goals. Our Purpose Statement, Commitments, and Beliefs define who we are, and they guide our decisions every day.Purpose.Gies Business shapes purposeful leaders through life-changing access to education, research and innovation.Commitments.Expand ACCESS to world-class business education, transforming lives in an inclusive culture where all are seen, heard, and valued.Foster EXCELLENCE in scholarship and teaching, which provides value for business and society and delivers educational opportunities at all stages in the learner journey.Fuel INNOVATION through a diverse, engaged community that’s inspired to discover new ways to do business and new ways to teach business.INCLUSION permeates all of our commitments and everything we do. Inclusion is essential for our scholars, learners, teachers, and leaders to thrive.Facilitate meaningful life-long ENGAGEMENT with the Gies Community in our pursuit of a shared purpose.Beliefs.Common HumanityWe believe in honoring every person with dignity and respect and creating space for authenticity and opportunity.Inclusive BelongingWe believe in building meaningful connections with empathy and fostering a community where all feel seen, heard, and valued.Purposeful InnovationWe believe in celebrating curiosity, challenging assumptions, and pushing boundaries to lead and model what’s next.Perpetual LearningWe believe learning and scholarship are ongoing pursuits that enrich individuals, organizations, and our community.Meaningful WorkWe believe in pursuing purpose and fulfillment to make work matter—for the betterment of ourselves and others.\\n\\n\\nDiversity, Equity & InclusionGies Business is committed to being a model for a diverse, equitable and inclusive community, being actively anti-racist, helping the next generation of business leaders do the same, and engaging the public and our corporate partners in these efforts. This commitment must be reflected among our students, within all aspects of our student and faculty recruiting efforts, and in our overall culture of discourse and community. Our Gies community stands united in recognizing the importance of these issues, and through the lens of our Business on Purpose mindset, each of us will be intentional about our work in this important area. While we acknowledge that we don’t have all the answers, we’re on this journey together. We can – and must – do better.Significant positive change requires careful planning, leadership, resources, and coordination. We have charged a steering committee and four associated working groups to make tangible recommendations about how our College can become a better leader in diversity, equity, anti-racism, and inclusion. After consulting widely with appropriate stakeholders, the steering committee will identify priorities and incorporate those into Gies’ strategic plans; direct investments to put initiatives on a path to success; ensure we are accountable and measure our progress; and transparently communicate the plans to our broader community.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMeet Dean Jeffrey BrownGies Business is a place to launch a fulfilling career and a place to spark the ideas that transform industries across the globe.\\nDEAN BROWN'S BIO\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nAdd Contact Information\\xa0\\n   \\n            \",\n",

He then returned to work at the university in various capacities from 1989 until his death in 2016 at age 85. Paul served as an assistant dean of the MBA program, assistant dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, associate dean and director of budgets, and visiting professor of economics. Under his leadership, the College established the Office for the Study of Business Issues in 1995, which later became Illinois Business Consulting (IBC).

Brown and Executive Associate Dean Brooke Elliott announced today that Dr. Nehemiah Scott has been named the new Associate Dean of Undergraduate Programs at the University of Illinois’ Gies College of Business. He replaces Dr. Kevin Jackson, who took a new position as Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in October.\\xa0Scott will officially take the role on July 16.He is currently a teaching professor of business administration and director of Gies’ supply chain management program. He joined the College in 2015.“For the last eight years, Nehemiah has been a vital part of our Gies community, and I’m delighted for him to step into this new leadership role,” said Jeffrey R. Brown, Josef and Margot Lakonishok Professor in Business and Dean. “He has a tremendous amount of respect for the academic rigor of our undergraduate programs, while at the same time, he is committed to finding new ways to break down barriers to education. He has a heart for our students that is clear and obvious in every one of his interactions and actions.”As associate dean, Scott will lead strategic planning, operations, budget, and communications — all with a focus on creating an unmatched student experience — for the Office of Undergraduate Programs at Gies. This includes admissions and recruitment, academic advising and student success, student engagement, academic affairs, access and multicultural engagement, and global programs. Gies has provided undergraduate education for more than 100 years and is widely recognized as one of the Top 5 public undergraduate business schools in the nation.“I’m honored to be the next associate dean of undergraduate programs at Gies, and I’m looking forward to elevating the standard of excellence we have built over the last century,” Scott said. “At my core, I want to see our students be well, do well and realize enduring success in their own way, both inside and outside of the classroom. It is our responsibility to advise, encourage and support them along that journey. I also look forward to providing our students with transformative educational experiences and leadership opportunities that inspire and show them how they can lead with purpose.”During his eight years at Gies, in addition to teaching, he has served in the supply chain management program – holding several leadership positions within the major. Scott earned three degrees from the University of Toledo: a bachelor’s in computer science and engineering technology, an MBA, and a PhD in manufacturing and technology management. Prior to joining Gies, he worked in the private sector and held teaching roles at the University of Toledo and Eastern Michigan University. “Nehemiah has taken on progressively larger roles throughout his time at Gies, and he has exceeded expectations every step of the way,” said Executive Associate Dean of Academic Programs Brooke Elliott. “He is an innovator, leader, and motivator who cares deeply about our students and is personally invested in their success.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore Articles\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n            ',\n",

       " 'https://giesbusiness.illinois.edu/news/2023/06/12/entrepreneurship-through-acquisition-gies-grad-puts-coursework-into-action': '           \\r\\n\\tGies News | Gies College of Business | UIUC Updates\\r\\n         \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJun 12, 2023\\n\\nAlumni\\n\\nFaculty\\n\\nFinance\\n\\n\\nEntrepreneurship through Acquisition: Gies grad puts coursework into action\\nWhen Gies Business graduate Josh Kirby walked into the Entrepreneurship through Acquisition class this spring, this time, he wasn’t there as a student. The 2019 finance graduate returned four years after taking the class himself to share how he lived out what he learned – acquiring a business in 2020.Kirby, who’s now owner, president, and CEO of Guardian Wealth Management in Peoria, credits the course with teaching him the ins and outs of small business acquisition and wants to show other students that entrepreneurship through acquisition is more than just a concept they discuss in class.“The acquisition wouldn’t have happened without knowing about the opportunity from this class,” Kirby said. “In a lot of ways, it was a blueprint and map to know where to start. I hope that students feel that they can do it, too.”Mark Smith, a senior lecturer of finance at Gies Business, launched the course in 2019 to teach both undergraduate and graduate students about a lower-risk route to entrepreneurship they may not have considered – buying a small business rather than starting one from scratch.“A lot of times, the idea of entrepreneurship is that you have to build something from the ground up, and that’s not true,” Smith said. “My definition of entrepreneurship is that it’s a person who wants to control their own destiny. If I build my own business, I control my own destiny, and if I buy a business, I control my own destiny.”The finance course, which takes place each spring, features lectures and guest speakers who teach students how to find, value, finance, and grow opportunities to acquire small businesses. Like Kirby, many of the guest speakers are Gies Business alumni. And those alumni inspired Kirby when he was a student.\\xa0 “I feel very appreciative that there are a lot of people who go out and achieve success based on what they’ve learned here and their relationships that they’ve made here,” Kirby said. “And they don’t forget to give credit to where they launched from.”Smith also values alumni guest speakers and believes students can relate to Kirby in a unique way because of how recently he was in their position.“Students can really identify with Josh because he’s a recent graduate, and I think it gets them excited that they can do this,” Smith said.Kirby was looking for a course to complete his schedule in the final semester of his senior year and didn’t know much about acquisition before taking the class. He signed up for the course on a recommendation from Smith. Kirby valued Smith’s advice, having worked with him through Illinois Enactus, a student organization that focuses on making an impact through entrepreneurship. The course taught Kirby exactly what Smith had hoped to instill.“Before the class, I felt like you had to invent something to be an entrepreneur, and this was my first insight that you didn’t have to,” Kirby said.Even with the information he learned in the course and knowing that acquisition is less risky than creating a  new business, Kirby knew there was still a level of risk involved, especially so early in his career. But when he discovered his uncle was planning to sell Guardian Wealth Management, Kirby knew he wanted to put his coursework into action, despite his fear.“This is a legitimate risk,” Kirby said. “It’s one where you have to get comfortable making sure that it’s a risk that also aligns with the reward you want both financially and personally.”Guardian Wealth Management, which offers investment management, tax planning, and estate planning, aligned with Kirby’s interest in entrepreneurship and with his desire to make a difference in people’s lives, so he pursued the opportunity, using what he learned in Smith’s class.\\xa0 “I hope to make something that can be scary for people less scary,” Kirby said of his work through Guardian Wealth Management. “There are a lot of people who have this emotional feeling around money, and it’s scary to them to figure out how to manage their money. I think that when you can bring in calming expertise and knowledge, that creates some peace for people. That’s a really rewarding feeling.”Smith appreciates Kirby’s gratitude for the course and his willingness to share his story with current students. And Smith is excited the class is helping shape students’ careers.“It’s validation that what you’re doing is making an impact and changing lives,” Smith said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore Articles\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n            ',\n",

One component is the self-directed, asynchronous part of the course, which will help you develop the baseline, foundational knowledge.  That material comes in the form of pre-recorded videos, which you can watch at your convenience, as well as complementary readings.  The second component is what we call the high engagement part of the course. This is an additional layer that goes on top of the foundational, baseline knowledge. It is an expansion of the depth and the breadth of the first set of materials. It involves weekly live sessions, where you will be in a virtual classroom with faculty and your classmates.  Faculty will be presenting additional materials or case analysis. During the live sessions you will have the opportunity to ask questions, and to present your work, either individually or as a group.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\nApply to the iMBA Program Today Apply NowRequest Information   \\n  \",\n",

It draws context from comments and code to suggest individual lines and whole functions instantly. GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI Codex, a generative pretrained language model created by OpenAI. It is available as an extension for Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Neovim, and the JetBrains suite of integrated development environments (IDEs).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?\\n      \\n\\n\\nGitHub Copilot is powered by Codex, a generative pretrained AI model created by OpenAI. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Does GitHub Copilot write perfect code?\\n      \\n\\n\\nIn a recent evaluation, we found that users accepted on average 26% of all completions shown by GitHub Copilot. We also found that on average more than 27% of developers’ code files were generated by GitHub Copilot, and in certain languages like Python that goes up to 40%. However, GitHub Copilot does not write perfect code. It is designed to generate the best code possible given the context it has access to, but it doesn’t test the code it suggests so the code may not always work, or even make sense. GitHub Copilot can only hold a very limited context, so it may not make use of helpful functions defined elsewhere in your project or even in the same file. And it may suggest old or deprecated uses of libraries and languages. When converting comments written in non-English to code, there may be performance disparities when compared to English. For suggested code, certain languages like Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Go might perform better compared to other programming languages.\\nLike any other code, code suggested by GitHub Copilot should be carefully tested, reviewed, and vetted. As the developer, you are always in charge.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Will GitHub Copilot help me write code for a new platform?\\n      \\n\\n\\nGitHub Copilot is trained on public code. When a new library, framework, or API is released, there is less public code available for the model to learn from. That reduces GitHub Copilot’s ability to provide suggestions for the new codebase. As more examples enter the public space, we integrate them into the training set and suggestion relevance improves. In the future, we will provide ways to highlight newer APIs and samples to raise their relevance in GitHub Copilot’s suggestions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        How does a customer get the most out of GitHub Copilot?\\n      \\n\\n\\nGitHub Copilot works best when you divide your code into small functions, use meaningful names for functions parameters, and write good docstrings and comments as you go. It also seems to do best when it’s helping you navigate unfamiliar libraries or frameworks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        How can a customer contribute?\\n      \\n\\n\\nBy using GitHub Copilot and sharing your feedback in the feedback forum, you help to improve GitHub Copilot. Please also report incidents (e.g., offensive output, code vulnerabilities, apparent personal information in code generation) directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes safety and security very seriously and we are committed to continually improving.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrivacy – General\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Will my code be shared with other users?\\n      \\n\\n\\nNo. We follow responsible practices in accordance with our Privacy Statement to ensure that neither your Prompts or Suggestions will be shared or used as suggested code for other users of GitHub Copilot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        How are the transmitted Prompts and Suggestions protected?\\n      \\n\\n\\nWe know that user edit actions, source code snippets, and URLs of repositories and file paths are sensitive data. Consequently, several measures of protection are applied, including:\\n\\nThe transmitted data is encrypted both in transit and at rest; Copilot-related data is encrypted in transit using TLS, and at rest using Microsoft Azure’s data encryption (FIPS Publication 140-2 standards).\\nAccess is strictly controlled. The data can only be accessed by (1) named GitHub personnel working on the GitHub Copilot team or on the GitHub platform health team and (2) Microsoft personnel working on or with the GitHub Copilot team.\\nRole-based access controls and multi-factor authentication are required for personnel accessing Prompt or Suggestion data.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?\\n      \\n\\n\\nBecause Codex, the model powering GitHub Copilot, was trained on publicly available code, its training set included personal data that was included in that code. From our internal testing, we found it to be very rare that GitHub Copilot suggestions included personal data verbatim from the training set.\\nIn some cases, the model will suggest what appears to be personal data – email addresses, phone numbers, etc. – but those suggestions are actually fictitious information synthesized from patterns in training data and therefore do not relate to any particular individual. For example, when one of our engineers prompted GitHub Copilot with, “My name is Mona and my birthdate is,” GitHub Copilot suggested a random, fictitious date of “December 12,” which is not Mona’s actual birthdate.\\nWe have also implemented a filter that blocks emails when shown in standard formats, but it’s still possible to get the model to suggest this sort of content if you try hard enough. We will keep improving the filter system to be more intelligent to detect and remove more personal data from the GitHub Copilot suggestions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Where can I learn more about GitHub privacy and data protection?\\n      \\n\\n\\nFor more information on how GitHub processes and uses personal data, please see the GitHub Privacy Statement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        What if I’m accused of copyright infringement based on using a GitHub Copilot suggestion?\\n      \\n\\n\\nGitHub will defend you as provided in the GitHub Copilot Product Specific Terms.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHuman oversight\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?\\n      \\n\\n\\nPublic code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. This is something we care a lot about at GitHub, and in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Does GitHub own the code generated by GitHub Copilot?\\n      \\n\\n\\nGitHub Copilot is a tool, like a compiler or a pen. GitHub does not own the suggestions GitHub Copilot provides to you. You are responsible for the code you write with GitHub Copilot’s help. We recommend that you carefully test, review, and vet the code before pushing it to production, as you would with any code you write that incorporates material you did not independently originate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Does GitHub Copilot copy code from the training set?\\n      \\n\\n\\nGitHub Copilot’s suggestions are all generated through AI. GitHub Copilot generates new code in a probabilistic way, and the probability that they produce the same code as a snippet that occurred in training is low. The models do not contain a database of code, and they do not ‘look up’ snippets. Our latest internal research shows that about 1% of the time, a suggestion may contain some code snippets longer than ~150 characters that matches the training set. Previous research showed that many of these cases happen when GitHub Copilot is unable to glean sufficient context from the code you are writing, or when there is a common, perhaps even universal, solution to the problem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        What can I do to reduce GitHub Copilot’s suggestion of code that matches public code?\\n      \\n\\n\\nWe built a filter to help detect and suppress GitHub Copilot suggestions which contain code that matches public code on GitHub.\\nCopilot for Individual users have the choice to enable that filter during setup on their individual accounts. For Copilot for Business users, the Enterprise administrator controls how the filter is applied. They can control suggestions for all organizations or defer control to individual organization administrators. These organization administrators can turn the filter on or off during setup (assuming their Enterprise administrator has deferred control) for the users in their organization.\\nWith the filter enabled, GitHub Copilot checks code suggestions with its surrounding code for matches or near matches (ignoring whitespace) against public code on GitHub of about 150 characters. If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to you. In addition, we have announced that we are building a feature that will provide a reference for suggestions that resemble public code on GitHub so that you can make a more informed decision about whether and how to use that code, as well as explore and learn how that code is used in other projects.\\nJust like when you write any code that uses material you did not independently originate, you should take precautions to understand how it works and ensure its suitability. These include rigorous testing, IP scanning, and checking for security vulnerabilities. You should make sure your IDE or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Other than the filter, what other measures can I take to assess code suggested by GitHub Copilot?\\n      \\n\\n\\nYou should take the same precautions as you would with any code you write that uses material you did not independently originate, and should take precautions to ensure its suitability. These include rigorous testing, IP scanning, and checking for security vulnerabilities. You should make sure your IDE or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFairness and broader impact\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?\\n      \\n\\n\\nGiven public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?\\n      \\n\\n\\nWe are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our feedback forum.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?\\n      \\n\\n\\nGitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to\\u202fcopilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        How will advanced code generation tools like GitHub Copilot affect developer jobs?\\n      \\n\\n\\nBringing in more intelligent systems has the potential to bring enormous change to the developer experience. We do not expect GitHub Copilot to replace developers. Rather, we expect GitHub Copilot to partner with developers, augment their capabilities, and enable them to be more productive, reduce manual tasks, and help them focus on interesting work. We also believe that GitHub Copilot has the potential to lower barriers to entry, enabling more people to explore software development, and join the next generation of developers. We are working to test these hypotheses with both internal and external research.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrivacy – Copilot for Business\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        What data does Copilot for Business collect?\\n      \\n\\n\\nGitHub Copilot for Business relies on file content and additional data to work.

       " 'https://resources.github.com/devops/fundamentals/devsecops/': \"The Fundamentals of DevSecOps in DevOps - GitHub ResourcesDevSecOps builds on the ideas of DevOps by applying security practices throughout the software development lifecycle to ship more secure code faster.Through collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement, DevSecOps offers a set of practices that help companies embed security into their work to build more secure, high-quality software at scale.\\nDevOps has transformed how many organizations build and ship software. But until recently one aspect of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) has remained outside DevOps: security. DevSecOps seeks to correct that by baking security into the software development lifecycle (SDLC) in the same way that DevOps prioritizes quality, speed, and deep collaboration throughout all stages of software development. For modern organizations, DevSecOps becomes just “DevOps”: security is baked into the SDLC experience.\\nOrganizations that adopt DevSecOps typically see advantages that include:\\n\\nReduced risk of data breaches: \\nDevSecOps seeks to make code secure by design. A combination of secure coding cultural practices, secure developer environments, and automated security tests throughout the SDLC help reduce the chances of security vulnerabilities or flaws making it into production software.\\n\\nImproved compliance: \\nDevSecOps practitioners often use automation to enforce code compliance and integrate policy enforcement tooling directly into the CI/CD pipeline.\\n\\nGreater confidence in dependencies: \\nThe modern technology stack depends heavily on third-party code, often from public package repositories. DevSecOps practitioners frequently leverage tooling and automated tests to identify potential issues before a software release.\\n\\nValue gets to end users faster: \\nBy creating a security-first culture and applying automated checks, DevSecOps reduces the need for distinct security reviews that slow down code deployments.\\n\\n\\nWhat is the main benefit of DevSecOps?\\nDevSecOps seeks to build security into every step of the SDLC. This ideally means that security related tests (automated and not) take place at each stage from coding to merging branches to builds, deployments, and on into operation of production software. Moreover, DevSecOps advances the idea that everyone working on a product is accountable for its security. This helps teams catch vulnerabilities before they make it to production and reduces the need for late-stage, manual security reviews, which can slow down software releases.\\nDevSecOps best practices\\nPush buggy code into production and the result might be a bad customer experience and potential lost business due to downtime. But if you deploy insecure code, the fallout can be far more severe.\\nDevSecOps is a natural evolution of DevOps and seeks to make security a core part of the SDLC instead of a siloed process that takes place right before a release. Just like how testing and operations teams were often siloed from development in the pre-DevOps world, security today is often the job of specialized teams whose work take place outside the DevOps lifecycle. \\nDevSecOps argues that security needs to be embedded across the SDLC. Whether your organization already practices DevOps or you’re looking at how to adopt a DevOps culture, here are the foundational best practices you need to establish a DevSecOps practice:\\n\\nCreate a DevSecOps culture: Success in DevSecOps relies on everyone taking responsibility for security. That means each person in the SDLC codes, builds, tests, and configures application and infrastructure settings defensively. Just like DevOps, DevSecOps thrives in an open culture where each individual works together to build the best and most secure product possible.\\n\\nDesign security into the product: DevSecOps seeks to design security into products from the initial planning stages to deployed production-level code. This means security work is planned alongside feature work, and practitioners are provided security knowledge and testing throughout each stage of their development work. The goal is to make security an everyday part of your team’s work.\\n\\nBuild a threat modeling practice: The seeds of security vulnerabilities are often sown before a line of code is written. Model potential threats during the planning phase and design your infrastructure and the application’s architecture to mitigate those issues. And periodic penetration testing, where a trusted person attempts to break into your system, can help unveil weaknesses you may miss in your threat models.\\n\\nAutomate for speed and security: Automated testing is used throughout the SDLC to ensure the right security checks happen at the right time. That gives people more time to focus on building the core product while ensuring security requirements are met.\\n\\nPlan security checkpoints in your product development: \\nIdentify transition points in your SDLC where the risk profile changes. That could be the point at which a developer merges their code into the main branch, which might increase the potential for that code to be run on the machines of colleagues and eventually reach production. In that case, opening a pull request might be a good trigger event for automated security checks, along with the appropriate manual escalations.\\n\\nApproach security failures as learning opportunities: \\nBuilding on DevOps’ culture of continuous improvement, a successful DevSecOps practice strives to turn security incidents into learning opportunities. This can be accomplished by leveraging audit logs, building incident reports, and modeling malicious behavior to improve tooling, testing, and processes to further secure your applications and systems. \\n\\nStay on top of dependencies: \\nUnderstanding and mitigating the potential threats from dependencies is critical to your product’s security. Apply the same threat modeling and automated testing to your dependencies as to your in-house code. At GitHub we’ve identified and shared details of tens of millions of threats in open source software, helping organizations and developers be more aware of and avoid vulnerabilities. \\n\\nBuild your analytics and reporting capabilities: \\nContinuous monitoring is a critical part of a DevSecOps practice—and that includes real-time alerts, system analytics, and proactive threat monitoring. By measuring every aspect of your application and your DevSecOps pipeline you can create a common point for understanding application health. Reporting dashboards and alerts highlight problems early. When a problem does occur, the telemetry you’ve set up—such as application-level logging—provides insight for incident resolution and root cause analysis.\\n\\n\\nDevSecOps culture\\nCreating a DevSecOps culture begins by making security everyone’s responsibility. This can be a big change for many organizations. Traditionally, security was something developers left in the hands of specialist security professionals. It could also become a point of friction as well. Engineering teams often looked at security practices as an impediment to shipping software fast.\\nDevSecOps fundamentally seeks to change this perception by making security as core to the SDLC as writing code, running tests, configuring services. Each new feature or fix begins with considering its security implications. Security and compliance policies are enforced through tests. When something goes wrong, it’s an opportunity to learn and to do it better next time.\\nAnd instead of something that slows down software releases, security in a DevSecOps practice becomes a part of the release itself leading to faster and more secure deployments.\\nBut building a successful DevSecOps practice requires building security into every stage of the SDLC. This varies from one organization to another. Even so, there are core pillars that define a DevSecOps culture. These include: \\n\\nPeople: \\nA DevSecOps practice seeks to remove the barriers between different disciplines and build a naturally collaborative environment where  each person shares responsibility for a product’s security and quality.\\n\\nProcess: \\nDevSecOps moves security from being a distinct stage that often comes at the end of the SDLC to an integral part of each person’s work. Automated security evaluations, security-focused unit testing, widespread monitoring, and defensive coding create rapid feedback loops where vulnerabilities are surfaced earlier in the product life cycle and can be fixed faster.\\n\\nProducts: \\nDevSecOps builds on the DevOps toolchain by using technologies such as CI/CD to automate the identification of security issues. Dependency scanning, static and dynamic application security testing, and automated policy enforcement tools are often used to help build security into every stage of the SDLC. A wide range of best-in-breed solutions can be integrated with one another to create an “open” toolchain. Other organizations, however, may find that more integrated and security-focused product suites can often provide a more holistic experience.\\n\\nGovernance: \\nContinuous improvement is central to DevSecOps and it requires creating a culture of measurement that enables practitioners to identify opportunities to refine processes and tooling.\\n\\n\\nDevSecOps pipeline\\nA DevSecOps culture seeks to establish security as a fundamental part of creating software—but that’s only one part of what it takes to successfully adopt a DevSecOps practice. The next step is to integrate security into each stage of a DevOps pipeline.\\nWith security specific tooling and processes throughout the SDLC, a DevSecOps pipeline helps practitioners design more secure products and catch security issues early in the product life cycle. \\n\\nCommon DevSecOps pipeline stages\\nDevSecOps builds on DevOps, and a DevSecOps pipeline builds on a DevOps pipeline. Just as DevOps integrated quality and speed into each step, the best DevSecOps pipelines are designed to anticipate key points in the SDLC where security issues are likely to arise.\\nThis breaks down into the following common DevSecOps pipeline stages: \\n\\nPlan: \\nIn a DevSecOps practice, security starts at the planning stage in the SDLC pipeline. This can include analyzing potential security threats and determining how to combat them with threat modeling. It can also involve designing security into your products proactively to ensure it’s baked into the work from the beginning with key data hygiene and other security decisions taken up front. \\n\\nCode: \\nAt the coding stage in a DevSecOps pipeline, it’s important to create a culture of defensive programming with policies that help practitioners proactively navigate security and compliance issues. This could be as simple as specifying rules for how to handle particularly risky aspects of code, such as NULLs, or involve broader guidelines on areas such as input validation. \\n\\nBuild: \\nIn the build stage, a typical DevSecOps pipeline will include automated security checks to catch vulnerabilities in source code before they hit the main branch. This can involve using pre-commit hooks to run static application security testing (SAST) tools where any potential issues in code will stop the build, much like a failed test, and provide time to fix any potential vulnerabilities in proprietary source code before work can progress. It should also include software composition analysis (SCA) tools to track open source components in the codebase and detect any vulnerabilities in dependencies. \\n\\nTest: \\nThe test stage of a DevSecOps pipeline is a key point where practitioners will develop a testing strategy and automated testing suite to catch any potential security vulnerabilities or issues. This commonly includes using unit tests at a base level to look for security issues such as the way in which the application deals with unexpected or malformed input. It can also include dynamic application security tests to find vulnerabilities in the application when run. This way, the test phase becomes as much as security as it does functionality. A good tip at this stage is to integrate dynamic application security testing (DAST) into the DevSecOps pipeline.\\n\\nRelease: \\nIn the release stage, a DevSecOps pipeline will often include additional automated security testing and vulnerability scanning to catch issues that might not have been apparent in earlier stages. Some organizations will also deploy the principle of least privilege where each person and tool has access only to precisely what they need. \\n\\nDeploy: \\nAt the deployment stage, a DevSecOps practitioner will work to ensure that code makes it to production only if it has passed security checks at each previous stage. This can involve applying automated tests to application code and the underlying infrastructure used to run the software in production to catch any run-time security concerns.\\n\\nOperate and monitor: \\nIn the operations and monitoring stages of a DevSecOps pipeline, organizations will often use application-level and infrastructure metrics to identify unusual activity that could indicate a security breach. When an incident occurs, use logging and other instrumentation can be used to pinpoint the issue and understand its impact.\\n\\n\\nDevSecOps automation principles\\nWhen it’s correctly implemented, automation accelerates the SDLC by enabling people to use technology to accomplish repetitive, manual tasks and deliver higher-quality software faster. DevSecOps takes automation further by integrating security tests across all stages of the SDLC to improve speed, consistency, and mitigate against potential risks. \\nIf DevSecOps makes security everyone’s responsibility, DevSecOps automation strives to give everyone the tools they need to ensure code and configurations are secure without requiring them to become security specialists.\\nWhen considering where to apply automation in your own DevSecOps pipeline, consider the following principles:\\n\\nAutomation should be strategic: \\nA DevOps practice often seeks to use automation to facilitate speed and quality across the SDLC. But just as being strategic is important in a DevOps practice, it’s equally—if not more—important to be strategic about how and when automation is applied in a DevSecOps environment. \\n\\nLet people focus on being creative: \\nAutomate repetitive tasks wherever possible. That way, people can save their time and mental energy for more involved work while checks are applied more consistently and at scale.\\n\\nSystematize code review: \\nUse tools such as static application security testing to automate elements of your code review. Human-led code review is still important though and it’s critical to ensure your code review checklist covers security issues specific to your technology stack. Create a feedback cycle so each time a new information becomes available you build it into the checklist. For example, when an incident occurs consider how you could have caught the problem earlier with a code review or automated test.\\n\\n\\n Learn how GitHub Advanced Security offers leading-edge security tooling for DevSecOps organizations > \\n\\n\\n\\nDevSecOps toolchain\\nAdopting DevSecOps starts with a cultural shift that involves making security a core concern of everyone involved in the SDLC. To accomplish this, organizations will often adopt new processes and build a DevSecOps toolchain that applies automated security tests and security tooling to the SDLC.\\nDevSecOps tooling often builds on common DevOps tools such as CI/CD, automated tests, configuration management, and monitoring. The goal is to integrate security-focused tooling into each stage of the product life cycle. \\nKey components of the DevSecOps toolchain\\n\\nAutomated security tests on commits and merges: \\nA basic goal of any DevSecOps practice is to catch issues in code before they can do harm by triggering automatic scans using pre-commit and merge triggers. Some of the scans organizations might implement include:\\n\\nCode scanning: Often called static application security testing, this evaluates code at rest—in other words, without having to run it—to discover code that could lead to a vulnerability.\\n\\nVulnerability scanning: Dynamic application scanning tools build and deploy the application to a sandboxed environment and then observe how it responds to known security threats.\\n\\nSecret scanning: Even with the most stringent policies, secrets occasionally make it into a commit. Secret scanning tools are used to catch them before the commit is made. These also pair with SCA tools, which are used to detect any vulnerabilities in open source dependencies within a given codebase.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExplore how GitHub enables DevSecOps organizations to apply in-depth automated security tests at all stages of the SDLC >\\n\\nConfiguration management: In DevSecOps, a general rule is it’s best to remove the uncertainty from systems configuration—and this is often accomplished by adopting infrastructure as code. Tools such as Docker, Terraform, and Ansible use YAML and similar configuration files that can be automatically scanned for issues, committed to version control, and rolled out automatically to multiple instances of a service.\\n\\nFind out how GitHub helps DevSecOps organizations manage application and system configurations through automation > \\n\\nContainer orchestration: In some environments, organizations may adopt a microservices architecture to better support complex, cloud-native applications. This requires maintaining multiple containers and scaling them as needed and securely—and that involves container orchestration tools. Just like configuration management tools, container orchestration tooling will often use YAML configuration files to dictate interactions between containers. \\n\\nRuntime verification: Also known as runtime application self-protection tools, these tools will actively monitor and/or direct threats towards your application as it runs with reports highlighting any vulnerabilities.\\n\\nContinuous monitoring and reporting: One of the simplest yet highly effective aspects of DevSecOps tooling is measurement—and that involves logging everything at the application and infrastructure level. The best tools will provide real-time intelligence when something goes wrong and include a reporting system so you can catch issues early. Outbound data from an unexpected port, for example, could indicate a compromise but without monitoring and reporting it might go undetected.\\n\\n\\nThe bottom line\\nSecurity is a defining issue in software development organizations today. Getting it wrong has far-reaching implications—both for the organizations and even the individuals involved. DevSecOps offers a framework for creating software securely from the very first step. And building on the well understood culture and processes of DevOps means that, for most businesses, a shift left to DevSecOps is a natural evolution.\\nBuild your DevSecOps practice on GitHub\\nGitHub is an integrated platform that takes companies from idea to planning to building to production, combining a focused developer experience with powerful, fully managed development, automation, and test infrastructure. \\nCompare pricing plans > \\n\\n\\nOur philosophy is to build automation and great DevOps for the company you will be tomorrow.\\n\\nSenior SCM Engineer Todd O'Connor at Adobe\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGo from planning to building\\nIncrease developer velocity\\n\\n\\n\\nBuild roadmap plans right next to your codebase and quickly assign tasks to team members with powerful project boards and tables that are fully integrated into your project.

A culture shift? A set of best practices? Specific tooling? In reality, it’s a combination of all three. DevOps is a way of working where development, IT operations, and security teams partner together to build, test, and provide regular feedback throughout the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC). From culture change to automation with CI/CD, let’s explore how DevOps teams develop shared context, expertise, tooling, and roles to ship better products.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe journey from silos to shared workflows\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDevOps sets a new standard for how we build software. Before the mid-2000s, developers, IT operations, and security teams typically worked in silos. Developers wrote code, QA teams tested it, and IT operations teams deployed it to production. Security teams checked code for vulnerabilities only after deployment. If someone reported an issue, the entire process started over again. This linear approach to software was slow and frustrating for everyone involved. Then in 2008, system administrator Patrick Debois and software developer Andrew Shafer created a working group to help bridge the gap between operations and development teams. Their best practices became the DevOps processes we know today.\\n\\n\\n          Learn more about the history of DevOps\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          Why adopt DevOps?\\n        \\n\\n\\nTraditional deployments are difficult, manual, and often break down, leading to employee burnout and unsustainable release cycles.  In comparison, recent research shows that using DevOps methodologies and principles like automation drives productivity and improves developer experience. DevOps makes building and shipping software faster, friendlier, and more collaborative—and automates almost all of the process. Developers on DevOps teams focus on their goals, prioritize work-life balance, and get more time for the projects they care about. This type of satisfaction builds on what we know from organizational psychology: Teams do their best work when they’re personally invested in the outcome.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Improved productivity\\n    \\n\\nReduce manual tasks and gain consistency, reliability, and efficiency.\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Cloud-ready code\\n    \\n\\nEasily provision environments in the cloud to help teams work faster at scale and meet demand.\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Security\\n    \\n\\nProtect customers and code while managing access across locations and environments.\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Collaboration\\n    \\n\\n\\n        Build and foster a collaborative culture with b communication.\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    We’ve gone from over 30 siloed software engineering groups to a largely cohesive team.

Whether you call them “steps,” “stages,” or “phases,” it all adds up to the DevOps lifecycle, the process DevOps teams use to build and ship software. Like any good DevOps approach, teams stay in constant collaboration and share many of the same tools and responsibilities from beginning to end.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Idea\\n    \\n\\n\\n        Teams gather requirements and feedback, and start sketching out the resources they’ll need. DevOps teams focus on continuous planning—plans that can be updated frequently, even daily. To build out roadmaps and track progress towards their goals, teams leverage project management tools everyone can access and use.\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n        Ideation stack\\n      \\nGitHub issues and project boards, Jira\\n\\n\\n            Learn more about planning and tracking\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Build\\n    \\n\\n\\n        As project managers assign tasks, developers get to work. Here, DevOps comes to life: With version control and cloud-based development environments, developers can make ongoing changes and review code together in real time. DevOps continuous integration (CI) also kicks in, where automated tools turn code code changes into builds, run tests against required checks, then merge and prepare code for deployment.\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n        Continuous integration stack\\n      \\nGit, GitHub Codespaces and Actions, GitLab CI pipelines, CircleCI, Jenkins\\n\\n\\n            Learn more about continuous integration\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Ship\\n    \\n\\n\\n        After passing initial checks, developers use continuous delivery (CD) tools to automatically push code changes to a non-production testing or staging environment.

In open source, developers encourage transparency, shared workloads, continuous feedback and reviews, and robust documentation. Industry reports like DORA’s State of DevOps from researchers Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble and Gene Kim, and popular DevOps frameworks like CALMS often use these best practices as benchmarks for DevOps success.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Collaboration\\n    \\n\\nCollaboration is at the heart of DevOps.

It also promotes InnerSource, the process of using open source best practices to build internal code.\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          But don’t forget DevSecOps\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is DevSecOps? Like development and operations, DevSecOps integrates automated security testing into every part of DevOps culture, tooling, and processes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor many practitioners, security was always meant to be part of DevOps. Instead of happening at the end of the SDLC, DevOps security starts at the source: Code. This approach is commonly known as DevSecOps or “shifting left.” Using automated security tools, developers find and address security vulnerabilities as they code instead of waiting for security teams to address them after deployment. By empowering developers to take responsibility for security throughout the DevOps lifecycle, DevSecOps allows development, operations, and security teams to find and remediate security issues faster.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    You fix it and you move forward, because guess what?

I no longer find myself needing to reach for spreadsheets or 3P tools which go stale instantly.\\n\\n\\nDan Godfrey\\n//\\nDevelopment Manager\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrequently asked\\xa0questions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        What is GitHub Issues?\\n      \\n\\n\\nWe all need a way to plan our work, track issues, and discuss the things we build. Our answer to this universal question is GitHub Issues, and it’s built-in to every repository. GitHub’s issue tracking is unique because of our focus on simplicity, references, and elegant formatting.\\nWith GitHub Issues, you can express ideas with GitHub Flavored Markdown, assign and mention contributors, react with emojis, clarify with attachments and videos, plus reference code like commits, pull requests, and deploys. With task lists, you can break big issues into tasks, further organize your work with milestones and labels, and track relationships and dependencies.\\nWe built GitHub Issues for developers. It is simple, adaptable, and powerful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        What are Projects?\\n      \\n\\n\\nAs teams and projects grow, how we work evolves. Tools that hard-code a methodology are too specific and rigid to adapt to any moment. Often, we find ourselves creating a spreadsheet or pulling out a notepad to have the space to think. Then our planning is disconnected from where the work happens.\\nThe new Projects connect your planning directly to the work your teams are doing and flexibly adapt to whatever your team needs at any point. Built like a spreadsheet, project tables give you a live canvas to filter, sort, and group issues and pull requests. You can use it, or the accompanying project board, along with custom fields, to track a sprint, plan a feature, or manage a large-scale release.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Can I update existing Projects to use the new capabilities?\\n      \\n\\n\\nYes. You can migrate your existing Projects (classic) to the new GitHub Projects through a new feature preview.\\nHow it works:\\n\\nWe’ll create a new project and copy all of the data from your existing project (classic) board to the new one.\\nOnce the data is copied, you can use the new project with all the new capabilities.\\nOnce the new project is ready, we will prompt you to close your “old” project, as the old project is not kept in sync.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        What plans have access to Projects?\\n      \\n\\n\\nAll users have access to the free tier of GitHub Issues and Projects.

development workflow. Easily deploy to any cloud, create tickets in Jira, or publish a package to npm.\\nWant to venture off the beaten path? Use the millions of open source libraries available on GitHub to create your own actions. Write them in JavaScript or create a container action—both can interact with the full GitHub API and any other public API.\\n\\n\\nWhat our community is saying\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“The ability to automate our workflows, as well as simplify and manage our issues, code, packages, CI, and deployment solutions, all in one place is powerful. We\\'re excited about publishing CI/CD workflows and to discover, reuse and contribute to the Actions ecosystem within Globant and the GitHub community.”\\n\\n\\nEzequiel Pellettieri\\nUnix and Database Services Tech Lead\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“With GitHub Actions, we get an excellent SaaS-based CI/CD solution that integrates seamlessly into GitHub and will soon allow us to run selected workloads on-premise through self-hosted runners across operating systems.”\\n\\n\\nIngo Sauerzapf\\nSoftware Development Manager, CI/CD\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“GitHub Actions empowers teams to define highly advanced pipelines without losing the focus on simplicity. It brings the power of the pipeline as code, matrix builds, and predefined environment together in one place. GitHub Actions makes it possible to build and share workflows via reusable steps and delivers what’s required to build the next-generation CI/CD pipeline.”\\n\\n\\nJeroen Knoops\\nSenior Software Engineer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Our mantra is to integrate into a customer’s SDLC, working with their existing tools and workflows. GitHub Actions gives us the perfect interface to our customer\\'s source of truth (the repository) and allows us to give them a native experience when interfacing with our solution.”\\n\\n\\nElliott Spira\\nGorillaStack Co-Founder\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSimple, pay-as-you-go pricing\\n\\n\\n\\nPublic repositories\\n\\n\\nFree\\nWe love open source\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrivate repositories\\n\\n\\n\\nIncluded minutes\\n\\n\\nFree\\n\\n2,000\\nminutes per month\\n\\n\\n\\nPro\\n\\n3,000\\nminutes per month\\n\\n\\n\\nTeam\\n\\n3,000\\nminutes per month\\n\\n\\n\\nEnterprise\\n\\n50,000\\nminutes per month\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional hosted runner minutes\\n\\n\\n\\nLinux\\n2 cores, 7GB\\n\\n\\n$0.008\\nper minute\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWindows\\n2 cores, 7GB\\n\\n\\n$0.016\\nper minute\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmacOS\\n3 cores, 7GB\\n\\n\\n$0.08\\nper minute\\n\\n\\n\\nSelf-hosted\\n\\nFree\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncluded, hosted runner minutes are consumed at different rates for each operating system.

None of this data is currently available publically because this project was not granted those rights by the authors.\\nRLHF\\nMy favorite contribution is the novel approach of semantic search retrieval during RLHF, using a dataset I iteratively produced by hiring a team of five Electrical Engineering students. That data is freely available on Huggingface here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/kastan/rlhf-qa-comparisons. We specifically cover the material necessary in the UIUC course ECE 120, intro to Electrical Engineering.\\nEvaluation\\nWe have a lot of models here. To evaluate which ones are helping, and which hurt, every time we push a new feature we re-run this evaluation. Our evaluation dataset of QA pairs is produced in house, written by expert electrical engineers. Using these questions, we generate answers with each of our models. Finally, we ask GPT-3 if the generated are \"better\" or \"worse\" than the ground truth answers written by humans. One limitation is that GPT-3 evaluates itself. GPT-3 nearly always thinks that GPT-3 is great, which is probably not true and a limitation of this evaluation method. Maybe we should run this same evaluation with Cohere\\'s models to compare.\\nNevertheless, iterative evaluation was crucial to ensure our new features were making our system better.\\nSee the full evalaution results here. See the evaluation code here.\\n\\nUsage\\nThis project is fully open source, with the exception of commercial textbooks.

This is the single best resource for finding trails using their info-rich map.\\nTires\\nTires are probably the best cheap(er) upgrade you can make to improve the capabilities of your bike. My advice only applies to Tubeless tires (TR for Tubeless Ready must be written on the sidewall).\\nI need very different front and rear tires. In the front you must maximize traction, in the rear you want more efficient rolling and large cornering lugs. The rear should also be a beefier casing if you’re someone who takes big hits or ride aggressive downhill. \\nFront: Maxxis Assegai 2.5″ 3C MaxxGrip DoubleDown casing — the heavy duty casing makes my tire hold a line much better, and gives me more stability at high speed. Also the DH casing is insanely reliable — no flats ever! If you don’t want the weight penalty (~1lb extra to go from EXO to DH casing), then just do DH casing in the rear, but it’s nice in the front too if you have the legs for it. \\nRear: Maxxis DHR 2.5 Maxxgrip DD Casing (or 2.4″ or 2.3″ for faster rolling speed). The DD casing is a perfect medium for fewer flats while still being on my trail bike. Heavier casings are even more important in the rear where big hits will brutalize your rear wheel. \\nTire inserts: I don’t think they’re worth the trouble. Increased maintenance is not worth it and I doubt the rim protection is all that good. I think I share a majority opinion here, especially amongst more practical riders, but some bike nerds still find them useful.\\nJumping\\nJumping a bike is a whole skill in and of itself. Start small and stay within your abilities or you will get hurt! To learn in a controlled environment, I’ve built my own jumps where I can slowly progress in size.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe construction is extremely straightforward, but finding the perfect curve is an art and a science. These are all quite “steep kickers” that send you high and short (not low and long).\\nI’d recommend the “pool noodle” technique for coming up with the desired curve. Rookie move is making the jump too steep!! You want a long ramp (mine are all nearly 4ft in length) with a very gradual curve upwards. Rookies make jumps too steep, so when in doubt go low.\\n\\n\\nThe biggest so far has it’s lip just over 3ft tall, and an 8ft gap from lip to landing.\\nPro tip: design your jump as a triangle to prevent it from tipping during use!\\n\\n\\nOSB (Oriented strand board) is the sidewall material, and much cheaper than plywood.\\n\\n\\n\\nRiding big drops\\nMy technique is to carry enough speed into the drop such that you don’t pull back on the handlebars. Just ride it off smoothly, and keep your weight centered over your wheels. Tires should land simultaneously, or with the front slightly sooner to absorb the impact. \\n\\nThe ~6ft drop on Scorpion trail at Galbraith. Love all the people who dedicated their expertise to building these intricate trails. Plz donate to WA Evergreen Mountain bike alliance.\\n\\n\\nA really friendly guy offered someone else a tow-in, but only I took him up on it!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLater, someone offered me a cold beer in the middle of my ride.

Pretty novel and creative way to summit unclimbable peaks.\\n\\nFirst Ascent: The Blocks in San Rafael Swell, Utah\\nIf you’ve climbed damn near every possible peak in Colorado, what do you do? Turn to first ascents to fill your time. That’s what we did with the help of legendary peak bagger, and close family friend, Dave Goldstein.\\nThe area is filled with Monument Valley-style towers rising out of the desert. Most of the tower is essentially unclimbable with no route up, but of course, there was a natural weakness to be found. Our ascent was primarily a 5.6 or 5.7 hand crack.\\n\\nDave Goldstein leads the pitch. The rock is brittle and he had a few holds break away under pressure.\\nFor the descent, we had little choice but to drill (somewhat suspect) bolts into the sandy rock, hence our triple protection.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen drilling bolts, don’t forget your blow tube!\\nUnbeatable view from up there. Check out this 360 Photo-Sphere from the summit!\\n\\nMy dad, Randy, rushing to be the first to the top (since the true summit is the top right).\\n\\nIf you ever make it up there, be sure to leave your name in the summit register 😉 \\n\\nWe stashed gear for some sport climbing of this adjacent tower the next day!\\n\\n\\nThe Classics with a Classic Friend\\nHiking the Enchantments with Terrence was amazing. My parents have climbed almost every peak in that range (Prussik is one of the most scenic!). Following in their footsteps is very fulfilling.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTrip Report: Boston Peak and Mt. Sahale\\n📍 Cascade Pass, North Cascades\\nThis trip report is intended to assist anyone attempting to summit Boston Peak in the North Cascades. Our route was 5th class, 16 miles, 6k ft elevation gain and took 13 hours to complete. Background info (including several fatalities on Boston) found on Summit Post.\\nThe approach\\nWe entered via the Sahale Mountain trail. Cascade pass and the Sahale Arm are simply gorgeous, and the arm offers a comfortable non-switchback ascent (woo!), while also being a unique geological feature. \\nThe Ascent to Sahale is great fun scrambling, with a snow crossing required (ice axe highly recommended). \\n\\n\\nToday was specific practice on glacier self arrest after a small slip I had recently that made me conscious of glacier training. One of my friends’ friends died in a crevasse this week, he was 25 and a skilled mountaineer. This is real to me. I need to keep training to avoid his same fate, rest in peace good man.\\nCascade Pass’s Topo Aurora was simply gorgeous in the morning. \\nTopo Aurora“The phenomenon of blue haze that results from the mountains sinking into the atmosphere”\\n\\n\\nI’d recommend cascade pass at sunrise. That Topo Aurora phenomenon is amazing! \\nThe traverse from Sahale to Boston is best completed STAYING ON TOP OF THE RIDGE. In particular, make sure to take to top line, and DO NOT traverse around the right side as shown below. This point is a little over halfway along the traverse starting at Sahale towards Boston.\\n\\nView from further away, my back is to the Sahale Summit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Climb\\nThe climb itself is fun, especially through the crack section. There are plenty of holds, but it’s steep and exposed. The rock quality is okay, and quite protectable with cams, Tricams and nuts. However, bring helmets since there’s LOTS of loose rock!\\nNatural Weaknesses: 4 Pitches, a STIFF 5.6, and was very steep at times and during the crack pitch. No existing protection, but there are 3 (or was it just two?) rappel anchors right along this route for the descent. My dad and I named this route Natural Weaknesses because I don’t think it’s an existing route, and we just wanted to mess around and find a fun way up.\\n\\nWe named the route just for fun, hope you enjoy. We didn’t see the purple 4th class route on our way in, we only saw it while returning (of course) so keep an eye out right at the base of the summit.\\n\\nBoston Summit with my dad. I don’t think Boston sees too much traffic, but there was a nice young guy from Oregon up there who took the photo.\\nThanks for reading, and I hope you get out and about in the great outdoors! If you used this guide, send me an email and, if you want, include a photo from your trip at kastanday[_at_]gmail.\\n\\nRussian Butte\\nOk this video is hilarious, and super short. \\n\\n\\n\\nA not often climbed peak, my dad only made it on his 5th attempt. Ropes required for the summit. Read his full trip report here, great info for fellow peakbaggers.\\nIt took us 12.5 hours to make it 9.6 miles, and 4k elevation gain. So it was very slow going through the bushwhacking, so keep that in mind. \\nSee our route below (GPX file in PeakBagger link). We came in from the north, you can also come from the South, but that route faces cliffs near the summit. \\n\\nGPX available on our PeakBagger trip report\\n\\nLove the look of these summit rock formations\\nWe set up 2 rappel stations for the descent. Lucky you if you can find them from these photos!\\n\\nThis is the view looking south. That’s why I’d suggest coming in from the north.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt does require fording across the Snoqualmie river, and hopping across a stream.\\nAlso, it’s a dream of mind to build a mountain bike track straight down this mountain. Just clear up some of the bigger sticks, and you’d have an insanely steep and rowdy descent. Jumping off rock drops, slaying the brown pow loam.. that’s the dream.\\n\\nPerfect location for a straight-down-the-fall-line MTB trail.\\nSurfing 🏄\\u200d♂️\\nGod I wish I knew how to surf. If you can take me surfing frfr send me an email kastanday[_at_]gmail.\\nSailing ⛵\\nGoal: I’m working on a trip down the Pacific coast, from Seattle to the tip of south America… One stage at a time, with help. This can only happen after a vaccine is available.\\n\\nOur new-to-us sailboat in Zezuantenejo, Mexico! Taken right as COVID-19 went worldwide, and I flew home one day before the boarder was partially closed (to non-essential travel).\\nScuba 🤿\\nOn hold until a vaccine is available. Goes hand-in-hand with our sailing trip down the coast of America’s. \\nParagliding 🪂\\nGoals: Just learn to cruise by myself, alone from the first flight if possible.\\n\\nIf you think we’d have fun together, email me!

This\\nis inspired by Xu et al. as well as the ZeRO Stage 3 from DeepSpeed.\\nFullyShardedDataParallel is commonly shortened to FSDP.\\nExample:\\n>>> import torch\\n>>> from torch.distributed.fsdp import FullyShardedDataParallel as FSDP\\n>>> torch.cuda.set_device(device_id)\\n>>> sharded_module = FSDP(my_module)\\n>>> optim = torch.optim.Adam(sharded_module.parameters(), lr=0.0001)\\n>>> x = sharded_module(x, y=3, z=torch.Tensor([1]))\\n>>> loss = x.sum()\\n>>> loss.backward()\\n>>> optim.step()\\n\\n\\n\\nWarning\\nThe optimizer must be initialized after the module has been wrapped,\\nsince FSDP will shard parameters in-place and this will break any\\npreviously initialized optimizers.\\n\\n\\nWarning\\nIf the destination CUDA device has ID dev_id, either (1)\\nmodule should already be placed on that device, (2) the device\\nshould be set using torch.cuda.set_device(dev_id), or (3)\\ndev_id should be passed into the device_id constructor\\nargument. This FSDP instance’s compute device will be that destination\\ndevice. For (1) and (3), the FSDP initialization always occurs on GPU.\\nFor (2), the FSDP initialization happens on module ‘s current\\ndevice, which may be CPU.\\n\\n\\nWarning\\nFSDP currently does not support gradient accumulation outside\\nno_sync() when using CPU offloading. Trying to do so yields\\nincorrect results since FSDP will use the newly-reduced gradient\\ninstead of accumulating with any existing gradient.\\n\\n\\nWarning\\nChanging the original parameter variable names after construction will\\nlead to undefined behavior.\\n\\n\\nWarning\\nPassing in sync_module_states=True flag requires module to be put\\non GPU, or to use device_id argument to specify a CUDA device that\\nFSDP will move module to. This is because sync_module_states=True\\nrequires GPU communication.\\n\\n\\nWarning\\nAs of PyTorch 1.12, FSDP only offers limited support for shared parameters\\n(for example, setting one Linear layer’s weight to another’s). In\\nparticular, modules that share parameters must be wrapped as part of the\\nsame FSDP unit. If enhanced shared parameter support is needed for your\\nuse case, please ping https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/77724\\n\\n\\nNote\\nInputs into FSDP forward function will be moved to compute device\\n(same device FSDP module is on) before running forward, so user does\\nnot have to manually move inputs from CPU -> GPU.\\n\\n\\nParameters:\\n\\nmodule (nn.Module) – This is the module to be wrapped with FSDP.\\nprocess_group (Optional[Union[ProcessGroup, Tuple[ProcessGroup, ProcessGroup]]]) – Optional[Union[ProcessGroup, Tuple[ProcessGroup, ProcessGroup]]]\\nThis is the process group used for collective communications and\\nthe one over which the model is sharded. For hybrid sharding strategies such as\\nShardingStrategy.HYBRID_SHARD users can\\npass in a tuple of process groups representing the groups to shard and replicate across,\\nrespectively.\\nsharding_strategy (Optional[ShardingStrategy]) – This configures the sharding strategy used by FSDP, which may trade\\noff memory saving and communication overhead. See\\nShardingStrategy for details. (Default: FULL_SHARD)\\ncpu_offload (Optional[CPUOffload]) – This configures CPU offloading. If this is set to None, then\\nno CPU offloading happens. See CPUOffload for details.\\n(Default: None)\\nauto_wrap_policy (Optional[Union[Callable[[nn.Module, bool, int], bool], _FSDPPolicy]]) – This is either None, an _FSDPPolicy, or a callable of\\na fixed signature. If it is None, then module is wrapped\\nwith only a top-level FSDP instance without any nested wrapping. If\\nit is an _FSDPPolicy, then the wrapping follows the given\\npolicy. ModuleWrapPolicy in torch.distributed.fsdp.wrap.py\\nis an example. If it is a callable, then it should take in three\\narguments module: nn.Module, recurse: bool, and\\nnonwrapped_numel: int and should return a bool specifying\\nwhether the passed-in module should be wrapped if\\nrecurse=False or if the traversal should continue down the\\nsubtree if recurse=True. Additional custom arguments may be\\nadded to the callable. The size_based_auto_wrap_policy in\\ntorch.distributed.fsdp.wrap.py gives an example callable that\\nwraps a module if the parameters in its subtree exceed 100M numel.\\nA good practice is to print the model after wrapping and adjust as\\nneeded.\\nExample:\\n>>> def custom_auto_wrap_policy(\\n>>>     module: nn.Module,\\n>>>     recurse: bool,\\n>>>     nonwrapped_numel: int,\\n>>>     # Additional custom arguments\\n>>>     min_num_params: int = int(1e8),\\n>>> ) -> bool:\\n>>>     return nonwrapped_numel >= min_num_params\\n>>> # Configure a custom `min_num_params`\\n>>> my_auto_wrap_policy = functools.partial(custom_auto_wrap_policy, min_num_params=int(1e5))\\n\\n\\n\\nbackward_prefetch (Optional[BackwardPrefetch]) – This configures explicit backward prefetching of all-gathers. See\\nBackwardPrefetch for details. (Default: BACKWARD_PRE)\\nmixed_precision (Optional[MixedPrecision]) – This configures native mixed precision for FSDP. If this is set to\\nNone, then no mixed precision is used. Otherwise, parameter,\\nbuffer, and gradient reduction dtypes can be set. See\\nMixedPrecision for details. (Default: None)\\nignored_modules (Optional[Iterable[torch.nn.Module]]) – Modules whose\\nown parameters and child modules’ parameters and buffers are\\nignored by this instance. None of the modules directly in\\nignored_modules should be FullyShardedDataParallel\\ninstances, and any child modules that are already-constructed\\nFullyShardedDataParallel instances will not be ignored if\\nthey are nested under this instance. This argument may be used to\\navoid sharding specific parameters at module granularity when using an\\nauto_wrap_policy or if parameters’ sharding is not managed by\\nFSDP. (Default: None)\\nparam_init_fn (Optional[Callable[[nn.Module], None]]) – A Callable[torch.nn.Module] -> None that\\nspecifies how modules that are currently on the meta device should be initialized\\nonto an actual device. Note that as of v1.12, we detect modules on the meta\\ndevice via is_meta check and apply a default initialization that calls\\nreset_parameters method on the passed in nn.Module if param_init_fn\\nis not specified, otherwise we run param_init_fn to initialize the passed\\nin nn.Module. In particular, this means that if is_meta=True for any\\nmodule parameters for modules that will be wrapped with FSDP and param_init_fn\\nis not specified, we assume your module properly implements a reset_parameters()\\nand will throw errors if not. Note that additionally, we offer support for modules\\ninitialized with torchdistX’s (https://github.com/pytorch/torchdistX)\\ndeferred_init API. In this case, deferred modules would be initialized\\nby a default initialization function that calls torchdistX’s\\nmaterialize_module, or the passed in param_init_fn, if it is not\\nNone. The same Callable is applied to initialize all meta modules.\\nNote that this initialization function is applied before doing any FSDP sharding\\nlogic.\\nExample:\\n>>> module = MyModule(device=\"meta\")\\n>>> def my_init_fn(module):\\n>>>     # responsible for initializing a module, such as with reset_parameters\\n>>>     ...\\n>>> fsdp_model = FSDP(module, param_init_fn=my_init_fn, auto_wrap_policy=size_based_auto_wrap_policy)\\n>>> print(next(fsdp_model.parameters()).device) # current CUDA device\\n>>> # With torchdistX\\n>>> module = deferred_init.deferred_init(MyModule, device=\"cuda\")\\n>>> # Will initialize via deferred_init.materialize_module().\\n>>> fsdp_model = FSDP(module, auto_wrap_policy=size_based_auto_wrap_policy)\\n\\n\\n\\ndevice_id (Optional[Union[int, torch.device]]) – An int or torch.device\\ndescribing the CUDA device the FSDP module should be moved to determining where\\ninitialization such as sharding takes place. If this argument is not specified\\nand module is on CPU, we issue a warning mentioning that this argument can\\nbe specified for faster initialization. If specified, resulting FSDP instances\\nwill reside on this device, including moving ignored modules’ parameters if\\nneeded. Note that if device_id is specified but module is already on a\\ndifferent CUDA device, an error will be thrown. (Default: None)\\nsync_module_states (bool) – If True, each individually wrapped FSDP unit will broadcast\\nmodule parameters from rank 0 to ensure they are the same across all ranks after\\ninitialization. This helps ensure model parameters are the same across ranks\\nbefore starting training, but adds communication overhead to __init__, as at least\\none broadcast is triggered per individually wrapped FSDP unit.\\nThis can also help load checkpoints taken by state_dict and to be loaded by\\nload_state_dict in a memory efficient way. See documentation for\\nFullStateDictConfig for an example of this. (Default: False)\\nforward_prefetch (bool) – If True, then FSDP explicitly prefetches\\nthe next upcoming all-gather while executing in the forward pass.\\nThis may improve communication and computation overlap for CPU\\nbound workloads. This should only be used for static graph models\\nsince the forward order is fixed based on the first iteration’s\\nexecution. (Default: False)\\nlimit_all_gathers (bool) – If False, then FSDP allows the CPU\\nthread to schedule all-gathers without any extra synchronization.\\nIf True, then FSDP explicitly synchronizes the CPU thread to\\nprevent too many in-flight all-gathers. This bool only affects\\nthe sharded strategies that schedule all-gathers. Enabling this can\\nhelp lower the number of CUDA malloc retries.\\nignored_parameters (Optional[Iterable[torch.nn.Parameter]]) – Ignored\\nparameters will not be managed by this FSDP instance,\\nthat means these parameters will not be flattened and sharded by FSDP,\\ntheir gradients will not be synchronized as well. With this newly added\\nargument, ignored_modules could be deprecated soon. For backward compatibility,\\nboth ignored_parameters and ignored_modules are kept for now,\\nbut FSDP only allows one of them to be specified as not None.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\napply(fn)[source]¶\\nApplies fn recursively to every submodule (as returned by .children())\\nas well as self. Typical use includes initializing the parameters of a model\\n(see also torch.nn.init).\\nCompared to torch.nn.Module.apply, this version additionally gathers\\nthe full parameters before applying fn. It should not be called from\\nwithin another summon_full_params context.\\n\\nParameters:\\nfn (Module -> None) – function to be applied to each submodule\\n\\nReturns:\\nself\\n\\nReturn type:\\nModule\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nclip_grad_norm_(max_norm, norm_type=2.0)[source]¶\\nClips the gradient norm of all parameters. The norm is computed over\\nall parameters’ gradients as viewed as a single vector, and the\\ngradients are modified in-place.\\n\\nParameters:\\n\\nmax_norm (float or int) – max norm of the gradients\\nnorm_type (float or int) – type of the used p-norm. Can be \\'inf\\'\\nfor infinity norm.\\n\\n\\nReturns:\\nTotal norm of the parameters (viewed as a single vector).\\n\\nReturn type:\\nTensor\\n\\n\\n\\nNote\\nIf every FSDP instance uses NO_SHARD, meaning that no\\ngradients are sharded across ranks, then you may directly use\\ntorch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_().\\n\\n\\nNote\\nIf at least some FSDP instance uses a sharded strategy (i.e.\\none other than NO_SHARD), then you should use this method\\ninstead of torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_() since this method\\nhandles the fact that gradients are sharded across ranks.\\n\\n\\nNote\\nThe total norm returned will have the “largest” dtype across\\nall parameters/gradients as defined by PyTorch’s type promotion\\nsemantics. For example, if all parameters/gradients use a low\\nprecision dtype, then the returned norm’s dtype will be that low\\nprecision dtype, but if there exists at least one parameter/\\ngradient using FP32, then the returned norm’s dtype will be FP32.\\n\\n\\nWarning\\nThis needs to be called on all ranks since it uses\\ncollective communications.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstatic flatten_sharded_optim_state_dict(sharded_optim_state_dict, model, optim)[source]¶\\nThe API is similar to shard_full_optim_state_dict(). The only\\ndifference is that the input sharded_optim_state_dict should be\\nreturned from sharded_optim_state_dict(). Therefore, there will\\nbe all-gather calls on each rank to gather ShardedTensor s.\\n\\nParameters:\\n\\nsharded_optim_state_dict (Dict[str, Any]) – Optimizer state dict\\ncorresponding to the unflattened parameters and holding the\\nsharded optimizer state.\\nmodel (torch.nn.Module) – Refer to :meth:shard_full_optim_state_dict.\\noptim (torch.optim.Optimizer) – Optimizer for model ‘s\\nparameters. – \\n\\n\\nReturns:\\nRefer to shard_full_optim_state_dict().\\n\\nReturn type:\\nDict[str, Any]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nforward(*args, **kwargs)[source]¶\\nRuns the forward pass for the wrapped module, inserting FSDP-specific\\npre- and post-forward sharding logic.\\n\\nReturn type:\\nAny\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstatic fsdp_modules(module, root_only=False)[source]¶\\nReturns all nested FSDP instances, possibly including module itself\\nand only including FSDP root modules if root_only=True.\\n\\nParameters:\\n\\nmodule (torch.nn.Module) – Root module, which may or may not be an\\nFSDP module.\\nroot_only (bool) – Whether to return only FSDP root modules.\\n(Default: False)\\n\\n\\nReturns:\\nFSDP modules that are nested in\\nthe input module.\\n\\nReturn type:\\nList[FullyShardedDataParallel]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstatic full_optim_state_dict(model, optim, optim_input=None, rank0_only=True, group=None)[source]¶\\nConsolidates the full optimizer state on rank 0 and returns it\\nas a dict following the convention of\\ntorch.optim.Optimizer.state_dict(), i.e. with keys \"state\"\\nand \"param_groups\". The flattened parameters in FSDP modules\\ncontained in model are mapped back to their unflattened parameters.\\n\\nWarning\\nThis needs to be called on all ranks since it uses\\ncollective communications. However, if rank0_only=True, then\\nthe state dict is only populated on rank 0, and all other ranks\\nreturn an empty dict.\\n\\n\\nWarning\\nUnlike torch.optim.Optimizer.state_dict(), this method\\nuses full parameter names as keys instead of parameter IDs.\\n\\n\\nNote\\nLike in torch.optim.Optimizer.state_dict(), the tensors\\ncontained in the optimizer state dict are not cloned, so there may\\nbe aliasing surprises. For best practices, consider saving the\\nreturned optimizer state dict immediately, e.g. using\\ntorch.save().\\n\\n\\nParameters:\\n\\nmodel (torch.nn.Module) – Root module (which may or may not be a\\nFullyShardedDataParallel instance) whose parameters\\nwere passed into the optimizer optim.\\noptim (torch.optim.Optimizer) – Optimizer for model ‘s\\nparameters.\\noptim_input (Optional[Union[List[Dict[str, Any]], Iterable[torch.nn.Parameter]]]) – Input passed into the optimizer optim representing either a\\nlist of parameter groups or an iterable of parameters;\\nif None, then this method assumes the input was\\nmodel.parameters(). This argument is deprecated, and there\\nis no need to pass it in anymore. (Default: None)\\nrank0_only (bool) – If True, saves the populated dict\\nonly on rank 0; if False, saves it on all ranks. (Default:\\nTrue)\\ngroup (dist.ProcessGroup) – Model’s process group or None if using\\nthe default process group. (Default: None)\\n\\n\\nReturns:\\nA dict containing the optimizer state for\\nmodel ‘s original unflattened parameters and including keys\\n“state” and “param_groups” following the convention of\\ntorch.optim.Optimizer.state_dict(). If rank0_only=True,\\nthen nonzero ranks return an empty dict.\\n\\nReturn type:\\nDict[str, Any]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstatic load_optim_state_dict_pre_hook(model, optim, optim_state_dict, group=None)[source]¶\\nThis hook is intended be used by torch.distributed.NamedOptimizer.\\nThe functionaility is identical to :meth:optim_state_dict_to_load\\nexcept for the different arguments.\\n\\nParameters:\\n\\nmodel (torch.nn.Module) – Root module (which may or may not be a\\nFullyShardedDataParallel instance) whose parameters\\nwere passed into the optimizer optim.\\noptim (torch.optim.Optimizer) – Optimizer for model ‘s\\nparameters.\\noptim_state_dict (Dict[str, Any]) – The optimizer states to be loaded.\\ngroup (dist.ProcessGroup) – Model’s process group across which parameters\\nare sharded or None if using the default process group.

Within this context, gradients will be accumulated in module\\nvariables, which will later be synchronized in the first\\nforward-backward pass after exiting the context. This should only be\\nused on the root FSDP instance and will recursively apply to all\\nchildren FSDP instances.\\n\\nNote\\nThis likely results in higher memory usage because FSDP will\\naccumulate the full model gradients (instead of gradient shards)\\nuntil the eventual sync.\\n\\n\\nNote\\nWhen used with CPU offloading, the gradients will not be\\noffloaded to CPU when inside the context manager.

This means that within the\\ncontext, only rank 0 will have full parameters and the other\\nranks will have sharded parameters.

For gradients,\\nit synchronizes and shards them (via reduce-scatter) after the backward\\ncomputation. The sharded optimizer states are updated locally per rank.\\nSHARD_GRAD_OP: Gradients and optimizer states are sharded during\\ncomputation, and additionally, parameters are sharded outside\\ncomputation. For the parameters, this strategy unshards before the\\nforward, does not reshard them after the forward, and only reshards them\\nafter the backward computation. The sharded optimizer states are updated\\nlocally per rank. Inside no_sync(), the parameters are not resharded\\nafter the backward computation.\\nNO_SHARD: Parameters, gradients, and optimizer states are not sharded\\nbut instead replicated across ranks similar to PyTorch’s\\nDistributedDataParallel API.

For buffers, this is only supported for\\nStateDictType.FULL_STATE_DICT.\\n\\n\\nNote\\nEach low precision dtype must be specified explicitly. For\\nexample, MixedPrecision(reduce_dtype=torch.float16) only specifies\\nthe reduction dtype to be low precision, and FSDP will not cast\\nparameters or buffers.\\n\\n\\nNote\\nIf a reduce_dtype is not specified, then gradient reduction\\nhappens in param_dtype if specified or the original parameter dtype\\notherwise.\\n\\n\\nNote\\nIf the user passes a model with BatchNorm modules and an\\nauto_wrap_policy to the FSDP constructor, then FSDP will disable\\nmixed precision for BatchNorm modules by wrapping them separately\\nin their own FSDP instance with mixed precision disabled. This is due\\nto some missing low precision BatchNorm kernels. If the user does\\nnot use an auto_wrap_policy, then the user must take care to not\\nuse mixed precision for FSDP instances containing BatchNorm\\nmodules.\\n\\n\\nNote\\nMixedPrecision has cast_root_forward_inputs=True and\\ncast_forward_inputs=False by default. For the root FSDP instance,\\nits cast_root_forward_inputs takes precedence over its\\ncast_forward_inputs. For non-root FSDP instances, their\\ncast_root_forward_inputs values are ignored. The default setting is\\nsufficient for the typical case where each FSDP instance has the same\\nMixedPrecision configuration and only needs to cast inputs to the\\nparam_dtype at the beginning of the model’s forward pass.\\n\\n\\nNote\\nFor nested FSDP instances with different MixedPrecision\\nconfigurations, we recommend setting individual cast_forward_inputs\\nvalues to configure casting inputs or not before each instance’s\\nforward. In such a case, since the casts happen before each FSDP\\ninstance’s forward, a parent FSDP instance should have its non-FSDP\\nsubmodules run before its FSDP submodules to avoid the activation dtype\\nbeing changed due to a different MixedPrecision configuration.\\nExample:\\n>>> model = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(3, 3), nn.Linear(3, 3))\\n>>> model[1] = FSDP(\\n>>>     model[1],\\n>>>     mixed_precision=MixedPrecision(param_dtype=torch.float16, cast_forward_inputs=True),\\n>>> )\\n>>> model = FSDP(\\n>>>     model,\\n>>>     mixed_precision=MixedPrecision(param_dtype=torch.bfloat16, cast_forward_inputs=True),\\n>>> )\\n\\n\\nThe above shows a working example. On the other hand, if model[1]\\nwere replaced with model[0], meaning that the submodule using\\ndifferent MixedPrecision ran its forward first, then model[1]\\nwould incorrectly see float16 activations instead of bfloat16\\nones.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nclass torch.distributed.fsdp.CPUOffload(offload_params=False)[source]¶\\nThis configures CPU offloading.\\n\\nVariables:\\noffload_params (bool) – This specifies whether to offload parameters to\\nCPU when not involved in computation.

The purpose of\\nMesh TensorFlow is to formalize and implement distribution strategies for your\\ncomputation graph over your hardware/processors. For example: \"Split the batch\\nover rows of processors and split the units in the hidden layer across columns\\nof processors.\" Mesh TensorFlow is implemented as a layer over TensorFlow.\\nWatch our YouTube video.\\nDo I need Mesh TensorFlow?\\nIf you just want data-parallel training (batch-splitting), then you do not need\\nMesh TensorFlow, though Mesh TensorFlow can do this.  The most common reasons\\nfor more sophisticated parallel computation are:\\n\\n\\nThe parameters of the model do not fit on one device - e.g. a\\n5-billion-parameter language model.\\n\\n\\nAn example is so large that the activations do not fit on one device. - e.g.\\nlarge 3D image model(experimental/unet.py).\\n\\n\\nLower-latency parallel inference (at batch size 1).\\n\\n\\nThe Mesh TensorFlow Approach to Distributed Computation\\n\\n\\nA \"Mesh\" is an n-dimensional array of processors, connected by a network.\\n\\n\\nEach tensor is distributed (split and/or replicated) across all processors\\nin a mesh.\\n\\n\\nTensor dimensions and mesh dimensions are named.  The layouts of all tensors\\nfollow from a set of user-defined layout rules which specify which\\ntensor-dimensions are split across which mesh-dimensions.  This ensures that\\nthe corresponding dimensions in different tensors are split in the same\\nmanner.\\n\\n\\nLayouts do not affect results - only performance.\\n\\n\\nThe implementation of an operation involves parallel computation on all\\nprocessors in the mesh, and sometimes also collective communication.  A\\nprocessor usually just manipulates the slices of the input tensors already\\nresident on that processor, and produces the slice of the output that goes on\\nthat processor.\\n\\n\\nGetting Started\\nInstallation\\nTo install the latest stable version, run\\npip install mesh-tensorflow\\nTo install the latest development version, run\\npip install -e \"git+https://github.com/tensorflow/mesh.git#egg=mesh-tensorflow\"\\nInstalling mesh-tensorflow does not automatically install or update\\nTensorFlow. We recommend installing it via pip install tensorflow or pip install tensorflow-gpu. See TensorFlow’s\\ninstallation instructions for details.\\nIf you\\'re using a development version of Mesh TensorFlow, you may need to\\nuse TensorFlow\\'s nightly package (tf-nightly).\\nExample Network (MNIST)\\nTo illustrate, let us consider a simple model for the MNIST image-classification\\ntask.  Our network has one hidden layer with 1024 units, and an output layer\\nwith 10 units (corresponding to the 10 digit classes).\\nThe code consists of two parts, the first describing the mathematical\\noperations, and the second describing the devices and tensor/computation layout.\\nFor the full example, see examples/mnist.py.\\nTODO(noam): verify that this code works.\\n# tf_images is a tf.Tensor with shape [100, 28, 28] and dtype tf.float32\\n# tf_labels is a tf.Tensor with shape [100] and dtype tf.int32\\ngraph = mtf.Graph()\\nmesh = mtf.Mesh(graph, \"my_mesh\")\\nbatch_dim = mtf.Dimension(\"batch\", 100)\\nrows_dim = mtf.Dimension(\"rows\", 28)\\ncols_dim = mtf.Dimension(\"cols\", 28)\\nhidden_dim = mtf.Dimension(\"hidden\", 1024)\\nclasses_dim = mtf.Dimension(\"classes\", 10)\\nimages = mtf.import_tf_tensor(\\n    mesh, tf_images, shape=[batch_dim, rows_dim, cols_dim])\\nlabels = mtf.import_tf_tensor(mesh, tf_labels, [batch_dim])\\nw1 = mtf.get_variable(mesh, \"w1\", [rows_dim, cols_dim, hidden_dim])\\nw2 = mtf.get_variable(mesh, \"w2\", [hidden_dim, classes_dim])\\n# einsum is a generalization of matrix multiplication (see numpy.einsum)\\nhidden = mtf.relu(mtf.einsum(images, w1, output_shape=[batch_dim, hidden_dim]))\\nlogits = mtf.einsum(hidden, w2, output_shape=[batch_dim, classes_dim])\\nloss = mtf.reduce_mean(mtf.layers.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(\\n    logits, mtf.one_hot(labels, classes_dim), classes_dim))\\nw1_grad, w2_grad = mtf.gradients([loss], [w1, w2])\\nupdate_w1_op = mtf.assign(w1, w1 - w1_grad * 0.001)\\nupdate_w2_op = mtf.assign(w2, w2 - w2_grad * 0.001)\\nIn the code above, we have built a Mesh TensorFlow graph, which is simply\\na Python structure.  We have completely defined the mathematical operations.\\nIn the code below, we specify the mesh of processors and the layout of the\\ncomputation.\\ndevices = [\"gpu:0\", \"gpu:1\", \"gpu:2\", \"gpu:3\"]\\nmesh_shape = [(\"all_processors\", 4)]\\nlayout_rules = [(\"batch\", \"all_processors\")]\\nmesh_impl = mtf.placement_mesh_impl.PlacementMeshImpl(\\n    mesh_shape, layout_rules, devices)\\nlowering = mtf.Lowering(graph, {mesh:mesh_impl})\\ntf_update_ops = [lowering.lowered_operation(update_w1_op),\\n                 lowering.lowered_operation(update_w2_op)]\\nThe particular layout above implements data-parallelism, splitting the batch of\\nexamples evenly across all four processors.  Any Tensor with a \"batch\" dimension\\n(e.g. images, h, logits, and their gradients) is split in that dimension\\nacross all processors, while any tensor without a \"batch\" dimension (e.g. the\\nmodel parameters) is replicated identically on every processor.\\nAlternatively, for model-parallelism, we can set\\nlayout_rules=[(\"hidden\", \"all_processors\")].  In this case,\\nany tensor with a \"hidden\" dimension (e.g. hidden, w1, w2)  is split,\\nwhile any other tensor (e.g. image, logits) is fully replicated.\\nWe can even combine data-parallelism and model-parallelism on a 2-dimensional\\nmesh of processors.  We split the batch along one dimension of the mesh, and the\\nunits in the hidden layer along the other dimension of the mesh, as below.  In\\nthis case, the hidden layer is actually tiled between the four processors, being\\nsplit in both the \"batch\" and \"hidden_units\" dimensions.\\nmesh_shape = [(\"processor_rows\", 2), (\"processor_cols\", 2)]\\nlayout_rules = [(\"batch\", \"processor_rows\"), (\"hidden\", \"processor_cols\")]\\nWhere does the network communication happen?\\nSome Mesh TensorFlow operations cause network communication.  For example, an\\neinsum (generalized matrix multiplication) is computed as follows:\\n\\nOn each processor, compute the einsum of the slices of the two operands that\\nare local to that processor.\\nIf no reduced-out dimensions are split, then we are done.\\nIf reduced-out dimensions are split, then perform an \"allreduce\" operation\\non the resulting slices - summing across any mesh dimensions over which the\\nreduced-out dimensions are split.\\n\\nWhere the allreduces happen depends will depend on the computation layout.\\nFor example, in a data-parallel layout where the \"batch\" dimension is split,\\nallreduces will happen when computing the parameter gradients, since this\\ninvolves matrix multiplications which reduce out the \"batch\" dimension.\\nHow do I pick a layout?\\nWhile results do not depend on layout (except in the realm of roundoff errors\\nand random seeds), performance and memory consumption depend heavily on layout.\\nFortunately, the auto_mtf subpackage provides a method for automatically\\nchoosing a layout.  For more information about what auto_mtf is doing to choose\\na layout, see its README file.\\nimport mesh_tensorflow.auto_mtf\\n\\ngraph = mtf.Graph()\\nmesh = mtf.Mesh(graph, \"my_mesh\")\\n# Insert model code here.\\noutputs = [logits, loss]  # iterable of mtf.Tensor, the outputs you\\'re computing\\nmesh_shape = [(\"processor_rows\", 2), (\"processor_cols\", 2)]\\nlayout_rules = mtf.auto_mtf.layout(graph, mesh_shape, outputs)\\nIt is possible for advanced users to eke out additional performance by tuning\\nthe layout (and model) further.  Mesh TensorFlow helps by accumulating and\\nprinting counters of computation/communication.  To start, here are some\\ntricks/guidelines.\\n\\nIt is illegal for two dimensions of the same tensor to be split across the\\nsame mesh dimension.\\nFor any compute-intense operation (e.g. einsum), make sure that all\\nmesh-dimensions are used to split dimensions of the inputs or outputs.\\nOtherwise, computation is duplicated.\\nTo keep the ratio of compute/communication high (i.e. not be bandwidth-bound),\\nsplit dimensions into large chunks.  This should be familiar in the\\ndata-parallelism case, where we want a large batch size per processor to avoid\\nspending most of our time communicating.\\n\\nThe Mesh TensorFlow Language\\nMesh TensorFlow (v0.0) is implemented as a Python library which can generate\\npart of a TensorFlow graph.  The user first builds a mtf.Graph (the analog of\\na TensorFlow graph) made up of mtf.Tensors and mtf.Operations.  As in\\nTensorFlow, this graph consists of simple Python objects.  The user then creates\\na mtf.Lowering object, which lowers the mtf.Graph into TensorFlow, adding to\\nthe default TensorFlow graph.\\nThe Mesh TensorFlow language is nearly identical to TensorFlow, with the\\nfamiliar notion of a Graph, Tensors, Operations, and automatic gradient\\ncomputation.  The principal differences are as follows:\\nMeshes replace devices\\nA Mesh is a n-dimensional array of processors with named dimensions.  Each\\nTensor is assigned to a Mesh, instead of a device.\\nTensor dimensions are named\\nEach Tensor has a static Shape, which is a tuple of different \"Dimensions\".\\nA Dimension is a (name, size) pair. For example, the shape of a Tensor\\nrepresenting a batch of images might be:\\n[(\"batch\", 100), (\"rows\", 28\"), (\"cols\", 28), (\"channels\", 3)].\\nLayouts\\nA Tensor is laid out on its mesh with one slice on each processor.  A Tensor\\n\"layout\", is an injective partial map specifying which dimensions of the tensor\\nare (evenly) split across which dimensions of the mesh.  No dimension of a\\ntensor may be split across two dimensions of its mesh and no two dimensions of a\\ntensor may be split across the same dimension of its mesh.  The user defines a\\nglobal set of layout rules in the form of (tensor-dimension-name,\\nmesh-dimension-name) pairs.  A dimension of a tensor is split across a dimension\\nof its mesh if there is a matching rule.\\nExample Layouts\\nTake our example Tensor image_batch with shape:\\n[(\"batch\", 100), (\"rows\", 28\"), (\"cols\", 28), (\"channels\", 3)]\\nAssume that this Tensor is assigned to a mesh of 8 processors with shape:\\n[(\"processor_rows\", 2), (\"processor_cols\", 4)]\\n\\n\\nIf we use an empty set of layout rules [], we get no splitting.  Each\\nprocessor contains the whole Tensor.\\n\\n\\nIf we use the layout rules \"batch:processor_cols\", then the \"batch\"\\ndimension of the Tensor is split across the \"processor_cols\" dimension of\\nthe batch.  This means that each processor contains a Tensor slice with shape\\n[25, 28, 28, 3].  For example, processors (0, 3) and (1, 3) contain\\nidentical slices - image_batch[75:100, :, :, :].\\n\\n\\nIf we use the layout rules \"rows:processor_rows;cols:processor_cols\",\\nthen the image is split in two dimensions, with each processor containing one\\nspatial tile with shape [100, 14, 7, 3].   For example, processor (0, 1)\\ncontains the slice image_batch[:, 0:14, 7:14, :].\\n\\n\\nSome layout rules would lead to illegal layouts:\\n\\n\\n\"batch:processor_rows;rows:processor_rows\" is illegal because two tensor\\ndimensions could not be split across the same mesh dimension.\\n\\n\\n\"channels:processor_rows\" is illegal because the size of the tensor\\ndimension is not evenly divisible by the size of the mesh dimension.\\n\\n\\nEinsum\\nMesh TensorFlow uses Einstein-summation notation, mtf.einsum(inputs, output_shape), using the (named) Dimensions as the symbols.  Matrix\\nmultiplication, broadcast, sum-reduction, and transposition can all be expressed\\nas special cases of mtf.einsum, though the familiar interfaces are also\\nsupported.  The operation is lowered to slice-wise tf.einsums, followed by\\nallreduce across any mesh-dimensions corresponding to the summed-out Tensor\\ndimensions.\\nReshape can be expensive\\nmtf.reshape(x, new_shape) is used to change a Tensor\\'s shape, potentially\\nleading to a new tensor layout and hence network communication.\\nCPU/GPU/TPU implementations\\nMesh TensorFlow works on CPU, GPU and TPU.  The TPU implementation is very\\ndifferent from the CPU/GPU implementation.\\nMulti-CPU/GPU meshes are implemented with PlacementMeshImpl.  In this case\\nMesh TensorFlow emits separate TensorFlow operations placed on the different\\ndevices, all in one big TensorFlow graph.\\nTPU meshes are implemented in with SimdMeshImpl.  In this case,\\nMesh TensorFlow emits TensorFlow operations (and communication collectives) from\\nthe perspective of one core, and this same program runs on every core, relying\\non the fact that each core actually performs the same operations.  This\\npiggy-backs on the TPU data-parallelism infrastructure, which operates the same\\nway.  This \"SIMD\" approach keeps the TensorFlow and XLA graphs from growing with\\nthe number of cores.  The differences between cores are as follows:\\n\\ndifferent slices of the variables (this works now)\\ndifferent positions in the collective communication (this works now)\\ndifferent slices of the infed and outfed tensors.  We currently work around\\nthis by requiring that all imported/exported tensors be fully-replicated.  In\\nthe future, we should handle this correctly.\\n\\nExperimental features\\nThe input pipeline of Mesh Tensorflow models might become a bottleneck, when\\ntraining with large input (e.g., high resolution images). We provide new APIs\\nand a new input pipeline for you to run Mesh Tensorflow models. You can find\\nthem under the experimental/\\nfolder. We suggest that you give them a try when your input is so large that\\nrunning Mesh Tensorflow models with the default APIs is almost infeasible.\\nTo be more specific:\\n\\nThe BROADCAST mode in TPUEstimator does not scale up to large inputs (images\\nof tens of millions of pixels). We provide a new input pipeline:\\nexperimental/input_reader.py.\\nSee experimental/model_executor.py\\non how to use it.\\nIf your model takes images as input and has convolution layers.

Our project placed in the top 10 (more specific rankings were not disclosed) and won awards for best use of data and best use of machine learning for the common good. Our program is not currently hosted publicly as our backend services carry hefty fees but we hope to change that by working on student pricing with those companies.\\nMotivation\\nOur goal was to attempt to tackle the growing issue of fake news, which has been exacerbated by the wide-spread use of social media. For example, many believe fake news on social media to be a large contributing factor to results of the controversial 2016 US election. We wanted to create an easy-to-use system to detect the credibility of a user’s claim or article.\\nOverview\\nThere are many ways one could attempt to detect fake or biased news on the internet. However, we feel our implementation based on stance detection offers the greatest flexability and are reliability without having to get into the weeds of labeling individual claims as true or false. Rather we aim for a more general approach classifiing articles from unknown sources as generally agreeing or generally disagreeing with sources of known (high and low) credability.\\nMoreover, our implementation is particularly compelling because we can accept user input as either a link to an article OR as any arbitrary claim to be fact checked like (Obama is not a US citizen). In this way our program acts as a fact-finding search engine and returns links to relevant articles along with that article’s stance (agree/disagree/is-neutral) on that topic! Our program offers tremendous research and discovery potential to users as well as simply checking claims.\\nWe wanted to create an easy-to-use system to detect the credibility of a user’s claim or article, based on the concept of stance detection. Fake news is tough to identify. Many ‘facts’ are highly complex and difficult to check, or exist on a ‘continuum of truth’ or are compound sentences with fact and fiction overlapping. The best way to attack this problem is not through fact checking, but by comparing how reputable sources feel about a claim.\\nProgram pipeline\\n\\nUsers input a claim like “Obama is not a US citizen”\\nOur program will search Event Registry’s database for thousands of articles related to the keywords.\\nWe run those articles through our home-grown stance detection machine learning model which will determine each article’s relevance to the claim and it’s stance on it. We determine if an article agrees/disagrees/is-neutral or is unrelated to the input claim.\\nWe then access our ever-evolving database of source reputability. If lots of reputable sources all agree with your claim, then it’s probably true!\\nThen we cite our sources so our users can click through and read more about that topic!\\n\\nParsing input and fetching articles\\nGiven a user URL or claim, we used Microsoft’s Azure Cognitive and IBM’s Natural Language Processing to parse the article or claim and perform keyword extraction. We then used combinations of the keywords to collect up to a few thousand articles from Event Registry’s database to pass on to the machine learning model. Here we aired on the side of collecting more rather than fewer articles because the machine learning will accurately determine relevancy further in the pipeline.\\nAfter combing through numerous newspaper and natural language processing APIs, we discovered that the best way to find related articles is by searching for keywords. The challenge was implementing a natural language processing algorithm that extracted the most relevant keywords that were searchable, and to extract just the right number of keywords. Many algorithms were simply summarizers, and would return well over 50 keywords, which would be too many to search with. On top of that, many algorithms were resource exhaustive and would sometimes take up to a minute to parse a given text.\\nIn the end, we implemented both Microsoft’s Azure and IBM’s Watson to process, parse, and extract keywords given the URL to a news article or a claim. We passed the extracted keywords to Event Registry’s incredible database of almost 200 million articles to find as many related articles as possible.\\nWith more time, we would love to implement Event Registry’s data visualization capabilities which include generating tag clouds and graphs showing top news publishers given a topic.\\n–Spearheaded by Henry Han\\nMachine Learning for Stance Detection\\nWatch a detailed rundown on our machine learning pipeline from this video we created (~4 min) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0n-0-3XhWc.\\nWe created and implemented a machine learning model in Tensorflow that’s based off of several research papers in the field of stance detection[1][2][3]. Our model uses a combination of Bag-of-Words, Google’s word-2-vec, TF, TF-IDF (Term Frequency, Inverse Document Frequency), and ‘stopwords’ inside Scikit-learn to vectorize our input. That is run through a single hidden layer with ReLU activation, a fully connected layer and a softmax activation function to produce one of 4 outputs. We are comparing an arbitrary body of text to an arbitrary claim. So our ML outputs whether or not our body of text is ‘related’ or ‘unrelated’ to the claim. If it’s related, then it outputs if the body ‘agrees’, ‘disagrees’ or ‘is neutral towards’ our claim. Our model achieved 82% accuracy on our test data (for pure stance detection.. not necessarily ‘fake news’ detection) [4].\\nOne challenge we faced was the relatively long running time of our program.\\xa0 Focusing in on the machine learning, initializing our model took roughly 10 seconds on a recent laptop.\\xa0 To help mitigate wait time, we began loading our model as soon as a visitor entered the site. Therefore, it was usually available before the user even submitted a search request.\\xa0 Once the articles were retrieved, the model only took about 5 seconds to compare our typical thousands of articles to the user’s claim before returning the results.\\xa0 These results, how the user’s claim compared (agree/disagree) to our reference articles were then passed into our source reputability engine to compute a final score: fake news or not.\\xa0 All subsequent searches from the same user would be conducted on the same session of that model, so no further computation or wait time is required.\\n–Spearheaded by Kastan Day\\nOther (worse) methods of Fake News Detection\\n1. ‘Fake News Style’ Detection\\nSome teams try to train machine learning models on sets of ‘fake’ articles and sets of ‘real’ articles. This method is terrible because fake news can appear in well written articles and vice versa! Style is not equal to content and we care about finding true content.\\n2. Fact checking\\nSome teams try to granularly check the truth of each fact in an article. This is interesting, and may ultimately be a part of some future fake news detection system, but today this method is not feasible. The truth of facts exists on a continuum and relies heavily on the nuance of individual words and their connotations. The nuances of human language are difficult to parse into true/false dichotomies.\\nHuman language is nuanced. Determining a single statement as true or false\\nNo databases of what’s true or false\\nMany facts in a single article existing on all sides of the truth spectrum — is that article true or false?\\nPaperspace’s GPUs\\nWe chose to use papersapce to train and run our machine learning model primarially because of how quick and easy it was to get a paperspace machine up and running for machine learning. This project was completed for HackMIT under a 24 hour deadline. Therefore, speed was of the essence and the MLL-in-a-box preset saved us a significant amount of time while trying to get our TensorFlow moel up and running.\\nI love Paperspace because it is:\\n\\nFast to setup\\n\\nML in a box elimates the nightmare that setting up CUDA can become.\\nGraphical mode is very useful when first setting up a computer\\n\\n\\nEasy to use\\n\\nWith Windows app terminals are dead simple to access\\n\\n\\nPlentiful V-RAM for a bargain\\n\\nOur model required roughly 12 GB of V-RAM which made simply the quantity of V-RAM required our biggest limiting factor when choosing a GPU.\\nAs of posting this article they’re way cheaper than the competition (AWS, Azure) for more V-ram and faster cards.\\n\\n\\n\\nSource Reputability Database\\nIn order for our application to work, we needed to be able to compare new stances to our ever-improving database of source reputability. We wrote a python script to keep track of all encountered sources along with a reputation score of calculated weight. As a start, we hard-coded reputations based off of nationwide research studies, and then every time we ran our algorithm we added any new encountered sources to our database. In order to do this, we calculated a reputation score for each new article by comparing its stance towards the input claim with the stances of sources with known reputation and averaging the result. In the future we hope to incorporate more accurate data-science technique’s to improve our database. As a smaller project, we also hope to figure out a more streamlined approach than keeping track of the database with csv’s by having a copy of the database exist outside of a single run of the application.\\n–Spearheaded by Josh Frier\\nWeb App Architecture\\nWe used ReactJS for our front end and a Flask dev server as our backend. The Flask server starts our scraping & machine learning prediction script with the parameters of the user’s URL or claim when it receives a POST request at an specific endpoint. Our dependencies include two open-source libraries: Semantic-Ui-React and SweetAlerts. We used Facebook’s “Create-React-App” tool to create our web application’s structure.\\n–Spearheaded by Jason Jin\\nTeam Members\\nWe’re all currently sophmores at Swarthmore College.\\n\\nKastan Day\\nJosh Frier\\nHenry Han\\nJason Jin\\n\\nReferences\\n[1] The University of College London’s short paper on the topic:\\n@article{riedel2017fnc,\\n    author = {Benjamin Riedel and Isabelle Augenstein and George Spithourakis and Sebastian Riedel},\\n    title = {A simple but tough-to-beat baseline for the {F}ake {N}ews {C}hallenge stance detection task},\\n    journal = {CoRR},\\n    volume = {abs/1707.03264},\\n    year = {2017},\\n    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03264}\\n}\\n\\n[2] Cisco-Talos’ work on the Fake News Challenge\\nhttps://github.com/Cisco-Talos/fnc-1\\n[3] The Athene Team for the Fake News Challenge.\\nTheir Github repo\\nTheir Blog Post\\nTheir technical paper\\n[4] Our training data came from the FakeNewsChallenge.org where in 2016 teams competed to develop stance detection models, and only stance detection models, which we built upon in order to do fake news detection.\\nShare this:TweetPocketEmailLike this:Like Loading... \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow\\n\\n\\nFollowing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKastan Day\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSign me up\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAlready have a WordPress.com account?

I’m fluent in machine learning best practices for large scale distributed systems, robust model training, high-speed model inference and continuous testing and integration of improved models. My work experience is in applied ML for vision, and 3D scene understanding (SLAM) for autonomous robotics at Sarcos and NASA. During my Masters I’m specializing in large scale, distributed ML modeling for scientific applications, working as an AI consultant on a heterogeneous team of scientists to solve cross-discipline problems with AI.\\nMy favorite tools are first and foremost Python, often super-powered by libraries to speed it up like Cython, Dask and multi-processing. PyTorch, Tensorflow and sklearn are home to me. Recently, my paid research is distributed ML training using Pytorch Distributed (DDP) and Tensorflow Distributed (tf.distribute), and I’m very comfortable with 3rd party distributed ML libraries like Ray.io and Horovod. Finally, I often build complex data engineering pipelines in Luigi, Airflow, RabbitMQ, Docker, Kubernetes.

During that initial\\xa0week on campus, the new class also took time to unwind with games on Parrish Beach, explored numerous academic paths at the annual academic advising fair, and received free plants from the Scott Arboretum.\\nOn the first day of Orientation, community leaders, including President Valerie Smith, welcomed the Class of 2023\\xa0and reflected on the journey ahead. On Saturday\\xa0night, new students enjoyed First Collection, a longstanding tradition held in the Scott Amphitheater that marks the official beginning of every student’s experience.

Spaced repetition memory systems make memory a choice, but they’ve suffered significant barriers to adoption. The mnemonic medium is designed to solve many of these problems.It was first used in Quantum Country. I’m now working to expand its scope considerably in Orbit. (see more Substantive examples of the mnemonic medium)Key design properties:The mnemonic medium gives structure to normally-atomized spaced repetition memory promptsThe mnemonic medium supplies expert-authored prompts to remove the burden of prompt-writingMnemonic medium prompts are interleaved into the reading experienceThe mnemonic medium may help scaffold prompt-writing through author-provided promptsThe mnemonic medium’s design relies on light-weight promptsThe critical thing to optimize in spaced repetition memory systems is emotional connection to the review session and its contentsSecondary properties:SRS retry mechanismImpactEffects of the mnemonic medium on reader memoryWhat’s the big-picture impact of the mnemonic medium on readers?The mnemonic medium keeps readers in contact with material over timeHypotheses/questionsExtending scope / scale:How does the mnemonic medium’s efficacy vary across platform-knowledge-style topics?How might the mnemonic medium enable readers in genres outside platform knowledge?Lessons learned from applying the mnemonic medium to non-technical textsThe mnemonic medium works well for linear primers in established fieldsMemory augmentation can accelerate the unpleasant early stages of learning a subject—does the MM’s costs outweigh its benefits outside these contexts?How might the mnemonic medium adapt to readers’ differing backgrounds and goals?How might spaced repetition memory systems intervene when the student struggles with material?Non-memory impact:The mnemonic medium may push readers to read more slowly and attentivelyInterleaved mnemonic medium prompts promote a feeling of safetyWhat if the mnemonic medium were reframed as a means to engage more deeply with a text?Different types of understandingThe mnemonic medium can help readers apply what they’ve learned through simple application promptsHow might the mnemonic medium support readers in building more complex understanding?Towards virtuosic use:Important attributes of good spaced repetition memory promptsWhat might constitute canonical uses of the mnemonic medium?In what senses is the mnemonic medium more than an annotation layer on ordinary prose?Embedded prompt templates may actively scaffold prompt-writing for mnemonic medium readersBenefit to author:Question-writing in the mnemonic medium may help the writer think about their topicOptimization:How should mnemonic medium review sets be spaced?Future directionsTaking emotion seriously: How might we apply insights from the mnemonic medium to forms which focus on deep emotional connection?Timeful text: The mnemonic medium can be adapted to author an experience which unfolds over timeThe mnemonic medium can generate interesting author analyticsThe mnemonic medium can surface “proof of memory” social signalsOS-level spaced repetition systemTurning any web page into the mnemonic mediumHow might we adapt existing texts to the mnemonic medium, without participation of the author?Spaced everything: The mnemonic medium can be extended to one’s personal notesOther host media typesMnemonic video may present a smoother on-ramp to mass adoption than mnemonic textTwitter threads could be an interesting context for the mnemonic mediumChallengesThe early mnemonic medium’s structures are too rigid for others to help define the medium… to adoption by end-users:Many people view memory as unimportant to deep creative workThe initial mnemonic medium is implicitly authoritarian in premiseThe mnemonic medium should give readers control over the prompts they collectMnemonic medium onboarding depends on a critical mass of contentSpaced repetition review sessions often become boring and detached without a steady stream of new promptsMass adoption of the mnemonic medium seems to require mass adoption of web publishingReading texts on computers is unpleasantRegular spaced repetition memory practice is an onerous habit to adoptSpaced repetition memory systems don’t rapidly demonstrate their benefitsSpaced repetition memory systems make you feel like your memory is worse than it really is… for designers:The dominant culture around spaced repetition memory systems is fixated on meaningless goalsThe mnemonic medium should be developed in a context where people really need fluencyI can’t easily iterate on the design of the mnemonic medium by testing it on myselfQuantum Country lacks a coherent spatial representation of the mnemonic medium’s cards as objectsExtremely data-dense texts need a different mnemonic medium designAggressively scaling the mnemonic medium in 2020 is premature… for authorsWriting good prompts for others is likely harder than writing good prompts for oneselfHow often and where should mnemonic medium review areas be inserted?Other implementationsLogin - DawnguideTakeAwayThought Saver',\n",

Argonne recently announced our win!\\nThis project perfectly embodied my goals for grad school:\\nSolve a thorny scientific problem with novel, creative, applications of ML.Enjoy a cross-functional team of scientists: experts in material science, polymers, math and computer science, where I was able to serve as the AI specialist.Work with super-compute hardware. ThetaGPU has 192 A6000 GPUs across 24 nodes. Each node has either 320GB or 640GB (!!) of GPU memory to train Very Large Models, and, crucially, the high-capacity networking InfiniBand (!!) to make that scale useful.\\n\\nI watched live when these compute nodes (DGX A100) were unveiled by Nvidia. I was delighted with the opportunity to train my models on these gorgeous machines.\\nMy wonderful heterogeneous team of scientists:\\n\\nAria Coraor – Molecular Engineering, de Pablo Group, PhD @ UChicago.Ruijie Zhu – Computer Science, MS @ Northwestern University.Seonghwan Kim – Material Science, PhD @ UIUC.Jiahui Yang – Material Science and Engineering, PhD @ Northwestern University (not pictured).Me, Kastan Day – Applied Machine Learning, MS @ UIUC.\\nProblem Overview\\nThe problem is to predict how molecules of plastic (polymers) structure themselves when left to settle into equilibrium. We used molecular structure to predict the “period” at which these layers repeat.\\nAI-predicted 3D time evolution of lamellae, credits to\\xa0Ge Sun,\\xa0Yifeng (Oliver) Tang\\xa0and\\xa0Yiheng Wu.\\nThis is well characterized for short chains of molecules but becomes more difficult as (1) molecules get longer and (2) as the number of types of molecules in the chain increases above 2. In this competition the polymers were always 64 sequences long and had 2 or 3 types of molecules.\\nOur input is a string representing the polymer chain: “AAABCCBBBCC” of length 64. There is also an “interaction parameter” which characterizes how strongly B-C molecules are repelled from each other, it is a floating-point number between 0 and 3.5.\\nOur output is a float number between 0 and 16, representing the length of the Lamellar period shown in these diagrams.\\n\\nThese visuals further lend intuition about the problem space. We’re working with polymers that are a “block” of “A molecules” for the first 32 positions, then they’re random for the remaining 32 positions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOur solution\\nI loved trying to understand the polymer’s key properties from the domain-experts on our team. Then I attempted to translate these key ideas into a ML model that attends to the proper features. What’s the right model to use?\\nAt first, since this is a “structured data” problem (not using images or audio), I thought XGBoost would be the most successful model. My prior research on which algorithms win in the real world shows that XGBoost dominates all structured data problems, while deep learning is more successful against “unstructured” data. However, the data has long-range dependencies that are not well captured by decision trees.\\nNext, I tried using Transformers since Attention would capture long-range dependencies. These occur when the polymer molecule’s tail “wraps around” and interacts with other parts of the molecule. However, attention is overparameterized, we have little data in this challenge and the model did not converge during training.\\nFinally, I tried transforming the molecular since problem into an image problem and used a CNN. Delightfully, this creative solution ended up providing the best results.\\nCNNKernel MachineAuto-encoder\\nBut the CNN can’t capture long-range dependencies! Enter feature engineering, a crucial step for most real-world problems.\\nWe created a set of new inputs by feeding them through exponential kernels (to capture long-range dependencies) and cosine kernels offset by different amounts (to capture long-range dependencies that occur mid-polymer-sequence). These features introduce new non-linear features that allow the model to see a fuller picture.\\n\\nAdditionally, we used a standard Autoencoder to provide additional non-linear features to the model. After training the model, we simply run the model over all our input sequences and extract the latent space (red box below) for each input sequence, and directly use that (lower-dimensional) vector as input to our final model.\\n\\nFinally, our model is built by running a CNN on the input sequence, then feeding the other feature-engineered values into the fully connected layers. This allows the fully connected layers to equally evaluate the inputs from each form of feature engineering to finally produce a final regression prediction of the lamellar period.\\nKernel-Based Multi-channel PolyConvNet\\nResults\\nIdeally, we would see all blue points fall exactly on the 45˚ Y=X black line. That would mean that each predicted value is exactly the same as the ground truth (“actual”) value. \\n\\nExplainability\\nDeep learning is notoriously difficult to explain. In our early data exploration, I used XGBoost to product “feature importance” values for each element of our input. Discovering which elements of our data explain our predictions will help up design the right model for the task. Furthermore, it helps molecular scientists better understand these interactions, so they can develop new hypotheses to test.\\nI was surprised to find that position 24 of [0-31] total positions had the greatest explanatory power, even more than the interaction parameter. Furthermore, it was interesting that the ‘tail’ of the sequence was the 2nd most critical area.\\n\\nExplanatory power of the input data.The first value (from the left) is ‘magnitude/interaction’ param. Top 3: (’24’, 0.537), (‘mag’, 0.490) (’30’, 0.383).\\nAnother important finding was that greater blockiness means greater lamellar period. We observed this after a qualitative analysis of the principal components of the latent space of our ML model. \\nSo we can see our model is able to predict our finally output, a regression score of lamellar period and this is evident in the PCA of the model weights, “the hidden space activations,” shown below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCompetitor’s solutions\\nI’d like to highlight another team’s work. They had an elegant solution of training a CNN model on each of the individual datasets then ensembling their predictions together via a weight value that was learned by the model. Model ensembles are common, but I like the idea that the weight parameter was learned, instead of human-determined.\\n\\nIf you enjoyed this post, read my other machine learning posts on kastanday.com\\n\\nShare this:TweetPocketEmailLike this:Like Loading... \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow\\n\\n\\nFollowing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKastan Day\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSign me up\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAlready have a WordPress.com account?
