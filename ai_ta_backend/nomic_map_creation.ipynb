The draft framework describes how EPA would apply the mitigations in the Strategy compared to mitigations in the other initiatives.\\nWhat can you do? Submit comments! Learn more!\\nThe draft herbicide framework and accompanying documents are available in docket EPA-HQ-OPP-2023-0365 for public comment for 60 days.\\xa0Comments are due September 22, 2023. Agricultural pesticide users are encouraged to learn about EPA’s plan and to start thinking about how these mitigation measures could apply to herbicide use in their operation. While extensive recordkeeping is not currently required for the mitigation factors described in the strategy, it is highly recommended that users begin thinking about how to incorporate these new elements into their current record systems. If you are applying according to label directions, proper records can only assist your defense should you need it. To help guide you, watch for shared comments from professional organizations such as the Weed Science Society of America (WSSA). In April, a WSSA press release linked their comments to EPA and encouraged growers to act now to understand the impact of ESA’s new compliance initiatives. One good suggestion they offered to growers is to learn how to use EPA’s Bulletins Live! Two which is where important application instructions will be found.\\nEPA’s Office of Pesticide Programs will present a webinar on this draft herbicide Strategy on August 10th at Noon Central Time. EPA plans to walk through the framework and take questions from grower groups and other stakeholders. Register today. Questions may be submitted in advance of the webinar by emailing sm.opmp.pesticides@usda.gov.\\nTo learn more about EPA’s comprehensive ESA workplan Check out our article, “Change Coming to How EPA Protects Endangered Species from Pesticides – Feedback Needed” in the November/December 2022 issue of this newsletter. Proposed mitigation measures are discussed in more general terms in this comprehensive workplan.

The Strategy — which is primarily designed to provide early mitigations that minimize impacts to over 900 listed species — is one of EPA’s most significant proposals to help overcome these challenges.\\nEPA focused the Strategy on agricultural crop uses in the lower 48 states because hundreds of millions of pounds of herbicides (and plant growth regulators) are applied each year, which is substantially more than for non-agricultural uses of herbicides and for other pesticide classes (e.g., insecticides, fungicides). Additionally, hundreds of listed species in the lower 48 states live in habitats adjacent to agricultural areas. The proposed mitigations in the Strategy would address the most common ways that conventional agricultural herbicides might impact these listed species. More specifically, EPA developed potential mitigation options for conventional agricultural herbicides to reduce pesticide transport via spray drift and runoff/erosion that could result in exposure to listed plants and listed animals that depend on plants.\\nEPA expects that the Strategy will increase the efficiency of future ESA consultations on herbicides with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), which has authority over most listed species that could benefit from the proposed mitigations. Under the Strategy, EPA proposes to identify and begin mitigating for potential impacts even before EPA completes ESA consultations. These early mitigations should expedite EPA’s ability to fully comply with the ESA by reducing impacts to listed species before EPA conducts most of its ESA analysis. Adopting mitigations earlier will also allow EPA and FWS to use their resources more efficiently in ESA consultations.\\nThe Strategy’s proposed mitigations to reduce spray drift, runoff, and erosion and thereby reduce the potential exposure reflect practices that can be readily implemented by growers and identified by pesticide applicators and that provide flexibility for growers to select the mitigations that work best for them. The Strategy also gives credit to landowners who are already implementing certain measures to reduce pesticide runoff. For example, existing vegetated ditches and water retention ponds will qualify for credits that reduce the need for additional mitigation. Similarly, the Strategy would require less mitigation on flat lands, which are less prone to runoff, and in many western states, which typically experience less rain to carry pesticides off fields. The Strategy also describes how the Agency could add other mitigation practices to the menu of mitigation options in the future, particularly to incorporate emerging technology or new information on the effectiveness of specific practices.\\nDraft Herbicide Framework Document\\nThe draft framework document titled, “Draft Herbicide Strategy Framework to Reduce Exposure of Federally Listed Endangered and Threatened Species and Designated Critical Habitats from the Use of Conventional Agricultural Herbicides” is 97 pages long and includes a discussion of both the proposed scope of the Herbicide Strategy and the proposed decision framework to determine the level of mitigation needed for a particular conventional agricultural herbicide. The draft framework document also includes examples of how the proposed herbicide mitigation would apply to some of the herbicides for which EPA has conducted case studies as well as EPA's proposed implementation plan.\\nSome of the accompanying documents are quite lengthy. The “Herbicide Strategy Case Study Summary and Process” is 666 pages!\\xa0 Coincidence on the number? I’m not sure. I haven’t made it through it all yet. The primary thing I gathered from perusing through the spreadsheet files was that managing these complexities must be a nightmare. The document, “Application of EPA’s Draft Herbicide Strategy Framework Through Scenarios that Represent Crop Production Systems” is only 17 pages long and includes possible scenarios. Examples 1 and 2 would be particularly fitting for Illinois corn and soybean producers. These are shared to help producers better understand how these mitigation practices may be used.\\nIn its ESA Workplan and ESA Workplan Update, EPA outlined this and other ESA initiatives to develop early mitigations that provide listed species with practical protections from pesticides. The Strategy complements those other initiatives, such as targeted mitigations for listed species particularly vulnerable to pesticides and Interim Ecological Mitigations that EPA has begun incorporating under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. The draft framework describes how EPA would apply the mitigations in the Strategy compared to mitigations in the other initiatives.\\nWhat can you do? Submit comments!

The Strategy describes proposed early mitigations for more than 900 listed species and designated critical habitats to reduce potential impacts from the agricultural use of these herbicides while helping to ensure the continued availability of these important pesticide tools.\\n“Ensuring safe use of herbicides is an important part of EPA’s mission to protect the environment,” said Deputy Assistant Administrator for Pesticide Programs for the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention Jake Li. “This strategy reflects one of our biggest steps to support farmers and other herbicide users with tools for managing weeds, while accelerating EPA’s ability to protect many endangered species that live near agricultural areas.”\\nThe Strategy is part of EPA’s ongoing efforts to develop a multichemical, multispecies approach toward meeting its obligations under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). EPA’s traditional chemical-by-chemical, species-by-species approach to meeting these obligations is slow and costly.\\xa0 As a result, EPA has completed its ESA obligations for less than 5% of its actions, creating legal vulnerabilities for the Agency, increased litigation, and uncertainty for farmers and other pesticide users about their continued ability to use many pesticides.

Today’s most pressing issues are related to climate change. An understanding of how human activity impacts the environment helps us make sense of how a zoonotic transfer of a virus to humans causes a global pandemic, and how rising temperatures increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires and storms. Environmental Education (EE) connects people to their environments, instilling values and knowledge that leads to better environmental stewardship of local environments and natural resources. There are several well-established EE programs offered throughout Cook County by Illinois\\xa0Extension and the Forest Preserve of Cook County (FPCC). Missing from these opportunities are programs available to middle school-aged children, the age best suited for EE experiences because their environmental sensitivities are still developing and early experiences in nature have been shown to have impacts throughout adulthood (Boom, 2017). This proposal seeks to develop a program, Illinois Inquiry Adventures in Nature (IIAN), for middle school children and their families, suitable for small groups during the pandemic\\xa0and expanding in scope to include classrooms when safe. A series of four seasonal activities\\xa0and teacher workshops\\xa0will be created to bring groups to their local green spaces, including FPCC sites. Groups will engage in open-ended investigations based on their own observations and questions, complete activities at home\\xa0and enact local community conservation projects. Research will be conducted to examine how individuals’ connections to nature and environmental stewardship change over the course of their participation. This program fills a local need in Cook County, creating a continuum of opportunities across ages, and will be made available to all residents in Illinois, and nationwide, encouraging the next generation of environmental leaders.\\n\\n\\nAssessing the Needs and Connecting Young & Beginning Farmers with Extension Resources in Northern Illinois\\nAwarded to: Illinois Extension in the College of ACES\\nPrincipal Investigator: Joseph Malual\\nCo-Investigators:\\nNikki Keltner, Extension program coordinator, Illinois Extension\\nGrant McCarty, Extension educator, Illinois Extension\\nHope Michelson, assistant professor,\\xa0Department of Agricultural & Consumer Economics\\nPROJECT SUMMARY\\nMore and more young people are engaging in small-scale farming, with many focusing on specialty crops and sustainable agricultural production. Despite this trend, entry into farming, which is a complex business, is challenging. Beginning farmers face serious obstacles in accessing critical assets, including startup capital to acquire land, farm equipment\\xa0and agricultural technical knowledge needed to develop a\\xa0successful agricultural practice and profitable business. The situation is complicated by lack of adequate research to understand the unique challenges facing this generation of farmers. In Illinois, there is limited research to understand how people new to farming navigate access to critical resources. This research project aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the needs and opportunities facing young and beginning\\xa0farmers in northern Illinois. We will identify and map farms owned by young and beginning farmers, examine their experiences and strategies used to leverage critical startup assets, including farmland and equipment, financial capital\\xa0and agricultural technical assistance, as well as strategies for marketing agricultural products. This project will build relations and connect this new audience with Extension resources, which can help\\xa0beginning farmers develop the knowledge and skills necessary for solving critical problems. Through interdisciplinary collaboration between Extension educators and specialists with faculty at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, this research will generate useful knowledge that can help beginning farmers, businesses\\xa0and communities make informed decisions and plan for future support of those new to farming. The\\xa0knowledge and practices discovered and identified through this project will be shared with Extension across the state. Extension educators can build on this knowledge to plan and deliver educational programming that empowers farmers to develop financially viable and sustainable farms. Those successful endeavors will, in turn, help to revitalize their rural communities.\\n\\n\\nNew Immigrant Foodways\\nAwarded to: Department of History in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences\\nPrincipal Investigator: Teresa Barnes\\nCo-Investigators:\\nGisela Sin, director, Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies\\nMargarita Teran-Garcia, Extension specialist, Illinois Extension\\nPROJECT SUMMARY\\nThis project will leverage new and existing research with immigrant communities about challenges and strategies in adapting home foodways to American food systems to create short instructional videos related to nutrition and cooking. The project addresses a complex issue at the intersection of three critical areas of Extension’s mission: food, health\\xa0and environment. It addresses the public need of new immigrant families to access information and expertise and develop sustainable strategies when faced with the bewildering array of often unhealthy food options in the USA', 'url': 'https://extension.illinois.edu/global/extension-funded-research-projects'}]}\n"

      "{'course': 'cropwizard', 'conversation': '\\n>>> user: What type of pest is most harmful to corn crops in Illinois and how can I prevent it?\\n\\n>>> assistant: The most harmful pest to corn crops in Illinois is the corn rootworm. Corn rootworms, specifically the western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera), are the most impactful species in Illinois and the North Central U.S. These pests can cause significant damage to corn plants by feeding on the roots, leading to reduced plant vigor and yield.\\n\\nTo prevent corn rootworm infestations, several measures can be taken:\\n\\n1. Crop rotation: Implementing a crop rotation strategy by alternating corn with non-host crops, such as soybeans, can help reduce corn rootworm populations. The larvae are not capable of surviving on soybean or other broadleaf plants, so rotating crops disrupts their life cycle.\\n\\n2. Utilize Bt hybrids: Planting corn hybrids that have been genetically modified to express Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) proteins targeting corn rootworm can provide effective control. These Bt hybrids produce toxins that are toxic to the pests, reducing their feeding and damage to corn plants.\\n\\n3. Insecticide treatments: Seed-applied insecticides containing neonicotinoid or diamide insecticides can be used to protect corn seedlings from early-season pests, including corn rootworms. Soil-applied insecticides can also be applied at planting to control corn rootworms and other early-season pests.\\n\\n4. Monitoring and scouting: Regular monitoring of corn fields for signs of corn rootworm damage, such as root feeding and lodging, is essential. Scouting helps determine if pest populations have reached economic thresholds that require action, such as insecticide application.\\n\\n5. Integrated Pest Management (IPM): Implementing an IPM approach involves combining multiple pest management strategies, including cultural practices, biological control, and chemical control, to minimize the impact of corn rootworms and other pests. This holistic approach aims to reduce reliance on chemical treatments and promote sustainable pest management.\\n\\nIt is important to consult with local agricultural extension services, seed dealers, or agricultural experts for specific recommendations tailored to your region and field conditions to effectively manage corn rootworm infestations.\\n', 'conversation_id': '3e5d4861-b128-4c64-96ac-87c74f3217e5', 'id': 2, 'user_email': 'avd6@illinois.edu', 'first_query': 'What type of pest is most harmful to corn crops in Illinois and how can I prevent it?'}\n"
