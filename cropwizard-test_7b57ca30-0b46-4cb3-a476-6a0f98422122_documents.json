safe with these burning tips.\nStay warm this winter\n\nOver two million cords of firewood are produced in Illinois each year. As energy prices continue to increase, more people are using or considering firewood as a supplemental heating source. Illinois Extension has safety tips for choosing and burning firewood for your home. Buy, harvest, and burn firewood confidently and safely while you consider which type of wood burning equipment to use.\u00a0For woodlot owners, we also feature growing and managing timber for timber harvest or recreational use.\n\nPractice firewood safety\nKeep your home warm this winter\nLearn about forest management\nWhat determines how much wood I need to burn?\n\nThe answer lies in the density, or weight per unit of volume of the wood species. Each species has its own burning qualities, but on a weight basis, all species of wood generate the same amount of heat. Typically, oak, hickory, and ash are sought. So what makes some species more desirable? For example, a cubic foot of oak weighs considerably more than the same volume of soft maple. More maple would have to be cut and used to get the same amount of heat as a lesser volume of hickory or oak.\n\nHigher density sometimes have drawbacks. Several hardwoods, such as osage orange and black locust, have higher densities, therefore, higher heat values per cord.

main content\nSign up for in-person pesticide applicator training clinics, testing across Illinois\nJanuary 29, 2024\nMichelle Wiesbrook\nJenna Braasch\n\nURBANA, Ill. \u2014 Certain pesticide applications require that the applicator be licensed and certified. It is important to ensure this training and certification is done before making a pesticide application. Putting understanding, experience, safety, awareness, and knowledge to the test helps ensure a safer application for all. The University of Illinois Pesticide Safety Education Program, PSEP, is currently hosting in-person training and testing clinics available statewide.\n\nWhile locations span the state, the number of clinics is fewer than previously experienced. Those interested in attending an in-person training clinic should register early, as seating is limited. To check out the 2024 training schedule and options, visit go.illinois.edu\/PSEP.\n\nThese large-capacity clinics offer a classroom setting using a fill-in-the-blank style provided workbook. Each clinic offers training and testing.\n\nThe training clinics run 2.5 to 3.5 hours, followed by testing. The pricing is $45 for General Standards or Private Applicator and $25 for each category, including Field Crops, Rights of Way, Mosquito, Turfgrass, and Ornamentals. Both one-day and two-day clinics are available, depending upon the offerings. Before registering, check training dates and times to ensure those selected are not scheduled to occur at the same time.\n\nPre-registration and pre-payment are required for all clinics and can be accomplished at the appropriate individual link found at go.illinois.edu\/PSEP or by calling 800-644-2123.\n\nOnline training modules will be available for those who prefer this learning method. Testing is offered both in-person and online. Complete details, including FAQ, cost, and registration for the online option, can be found at the same link provided above.\n\nIf you are new to the process or looking for more information about registering to attend a clinic or the licensing process, visit the Illinois Pesticide Review Newsletter at go.illinois.edu\/PesticideReview.\n\nFor questions or if a reasonable accommodation is needed to participate in this program, contact Jean Miles, PSEP program facilitator, at jmiles1@illinois.edu or 217-265-0670.

There are an estimated 11,500 snow shovel-related injuries and medical emergencies a year. Follow these tips to prevent aches and pains this winter season.\n\n\u201cAs residents of the Midwest, we understand weather can be subject to change in the blink of an eye. When heading out for snow removal, check for icy conditions underneath the snow. This can prevent slips and falls that could lead to unplanned injuries and expensive emergency room visits,\u201d says Justin Rumpza, PT, DPT. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nProper form can help prevent injury. 3 tips on snow shoveling technique from a physical therapist:\nDecrease the amount of snow you are lifting in each load. Make sure the shovel is not too short for you and feels comfortable.\nAdjust your form to help reduce risk of injury- lift with your legs, not your back. Decrease twisting when throwing the snow.\nA split stance is a powerful stance to use when shoveling and can protect the lower back.\n\nPre-Shoveling Warm-Up Exercises\n\nPick a few exercises to warm your body up before going to work on that fresh powder. This can significantly reduce the risk of muscle strain!\nSide-lying Open Book Thoracic Lumbar Rotation and Extension-\u00a0This is a great mobility exercise to help loosen up that stiff back after a long night of stationary rest.\nRomanian Deadlift-\u00a0This exercise focuses on activation of those glutes, the big butt muscles that are the largest muscle in your body and can take on the challenge of shoveling snow.\nMini Squat with Counter Support-\u00a0Another great exercise to warm up those big quadriceps muscles on the other side of your legs.\u00a0 Remember you\u2019re lifting with your legs today, not your back.\nJumping Jacks-\u00a0I know, you haven\u2019t done these since junior high gym class, but they remain a great way to get the blood flowing through the body.\nPrevent aches and pains with these 3 takeaways from Dr. Cheryl True:\nKeeping active rather than being sedentary in the following days can reduce muscle soreness. Gentle exercise such as walking or stretching can warm and stretch sore muscles and increase blood flow to those areas. Applying ice to\u00a0especially sore spots can\u00a0reduce inflammation. Apply ice to those areas\u00a0for 20 min intervals over the first 24-48 hours, then alternate with heat. Usually, after a couple of days, you will start to feel better.\u00a0\nA warm bath with Epsom salts can also relax tight muscles.\nStaying well-hydrated and eating a healthy diet can be helpful for recovery after shoveling.\u00a0Protein-rich foods and complex carbohydrates are essential for muscle repair.\nInjuries do happen, so be prepared to seek medical advice if you\u2019re faced with these scenarios.\nIf you have chest pain, shortness of breath, or other worrisome symptoms of heart disease that develop while shoveling, stop and seek care immediately. The combination of physical exertion and cold air can trigger a heart attack in at-risk individuals.\nIf you've had a fall or have areas of injury that have unusual or unexpected pain or swelling that isn't improving or worsens, call your primary care physician for advice, or a musculoskeletal specialist for treatment in reducing and managing your symptoms.\u00a0\n\nWritten by:\u00a0Kristin Bogdonas, nutrition and wellness educator serving\u00a0Henry, Mercer, Rock Island, and Stark Counties.\n\nSources:\n\nJustin Rumpza, PT, DPT, ORA Orthopedics, Moline, IL.\nDr. Cheryl True, MD, DipABLM, FACLM, True Lifestyle Medicine Clinic, Davenport, IA.\nLive Well.

bee hotel to support pollinator research\nJanuary 24, 2024\nEmily Steele\n\nURBANA, Ill. \u2014 Bee hotels buzz with activity, but is it the right kind? A graduate student at University of Illinois is researching bees and needs help, in the form of donated used bee hotels, from the public to understand if these man-made nests are helping or harming bee populations in Illinois.\n\nSimilar to bird or bat houses, bee hotels are artificial habitats made of plant stems or drilled wood for cavity-nesting bees that people can put in their yards. The idea is to provide homes for native bees in areas where there aren\u2019t naturally occurring nest materials, but the research shows mixed results on their benefits. Some studies found the hotels led to higher species diversity, while others warn they host invasive bees, disease, and parasites.\n\nTimo Wayman, an Entomology graduate student at University of Illinois, is interested in native bee conservation and bee parasites and is conducting a research project on bee hotels in Illinois.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that there is a lot we don\u2019t know,\u201d Wayman said. \u201cBee hotels could be easy targets for the natural enemies of native bees. Under such close quarters, diseases and parasites are free to move from one nest to the next and insect-eating birds can clear out bee hotels in one easy meal.\"\n\nWayman plans to collect bee hotels from rural and urban areas across Illinois and dissect them to understand what species are using them. The project requires donations of bee hotels from the public. Anyone who donates a hotel to the project will receive a personalized report on the findings and guidelines for future efforts to support bees.\n\n\u201cEach hotel will be critical for a better understanding of what is going on inside and how we can all better help native bee populations,\u201d they said.\n\nExplore more about the project and learn how to submit a bee hotel that is at least two years old at go.illinois.edu\/BeeHotel. Qualifying bee hotel submissions are needed by March 1, 2024.

as a Retirement Hobby\nEpisode Number\n126\nDate Published\nJanuary 30, 2024\nEpisode Show Notes \/ Description\nEver think about what will captivate you in retirement? You don\u2019t want to just sit around but you don\u2019t want to over-commit now that you have your own time. Phenology could be a retirement hobby. Join Peggy Doty to talk about how phenology offers an activity for your mind and just enough commitment to wake up interested in this new idea. Phenology is a meeting of people and the wild living things around them, and you can schedule your meeting any time you like.\n\nBooks referenced:\nThe Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne & A

since 2007. The focus is to examine the state of stress nationwide and understand its impact. The study in 2023 indicated that 55% of Americans are stressed during the day. Managing stress can help emotionally, physically, socially, and mentally. Sometimes, the holiday season adds a little extra stress because we might have to pay attention to more responsibilities, such as seasonal deadlines, packed schedules, dreading specific functions, and extra financial burdens.\n\nMichelle Grocke, Ph.D. Health & Wellness Specialist MSU talks about Positive Ways to Manage Stress.\u00a0\n\nHere are a few coping strategies to get you started:\n\nTime management- Life is complicated enough, and one way to manage stress is to manage your time.\u00a0Finding a balance between work, education, pleasure, and social time is necessary. Only add a task to your calendar if you can devote time to completing it. Commit to \"fun\" time. Make time for activities that you enjoy. Devote time to a task. Think about focusing on one thing at a time. Multi-tasking is no longer the buzzword. When we switch back and forth between tasks, we lose something in between. It doesn't hurt to organize your environment. Minimize distractions and maximize your focus. You might have to change where you work, study, or do another task. Utilize friends, family, and pets to help you stay on task.\n\nExercise- We\u00a0have often heard that physical activity is one of the best stress management methods. Two stress hormones, adrenaline and cortisol, can harm us if we are under pressure for a long time. Increasing your heart rate helps improve blood flow and heart health. If you are new to starting an exercise program, check with your doctor first for ideas on where to begin. Think of ways to insert movement into your day, whether going for a walk with a friend instead of having dinner or stretching while you stand at the copier.\n\nRelax and Breath-Building relaxation into your day can be one of the most productive things you can do to help yourself. There are many approaches you can take to relax. Mindfulness is a meditation in which you focus on being aware of what you are sensing and feeling in the moment. How one practices mindfulness can involve breathing methods, guided imagery, and other techniques to relax the body and mind. As we say, relax and breathe.\n\nNutrition-\u00a0A balanced diet can support a healthy immune system and provide the extra energy needed to cope with stressful events. A busy lifestyle sometimes interferes with proper meal selection, so planning is essential. Identify a specific day of the week to plan your menu. Prepare your meals and think about storage. In addition, think about your alcohol and caffeine intake. Alcohol is a depressant that makes you feel relaxed in the short term. Caffeine can elevate cortisol levels and trigger our stress response. The FDA recommends consuming no more than 400 mg of caffeine per day.\n\nQuality Sleep- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gives a recommended amount of sleep based on age. The amount of sleep you get is significant, but sleep quality contributes to your health and well-being. Here are a few tips for improving your sleep habits: going to bed at the same time each night and getting up at the same time; Making sure your bedroom is quiet, dark, and the temperature is comfortable; Remove electronic devices; Avoid large meals and too much caffeine and alcohol; exercise during the day because physical activity helps you fall asleep easier.\n\nTalking to others- Research from UCLA suggests that putting your feelings into words called \"affect labeling\" can diminish the amygdala's response when encountering upsetting things. Writing or discussing experiences can positively impact one's health and immune system. When we hold back thoughts and emotions, it can be stressful. You have negative feelings either way, but it works when you repress them, which affects the brain and body. Remember that meditating on the negatives or consistently focusing on and discussing negative experiences can be highly damaging. Talking about stressors and focusing on things that make you grateful is essential. For every negative thought, you need to have five positive ones. Think about looking at or catching those joyous moments. Whether you keep a grateful journal stockpile of happy memories, make sure you intentionally see the positives and talk about those as well.\n\nConsider these approaches and how you can better handle

climate changed over time?\n\nIn the last 3 million years, climate has gone between tens of thousands of years of cooling followed by a much shorter period of warming. Today's rapid warming is happening 20 times faster than our historical pace. The causes are both natural- and human-based. The consequences of a hotter earth are substantial.\n\u00a0\n\nNature impacts climate over time:\u00a0\nLand masses changing position through tectonic plate movement\nChanges in ocean currents (also due to plate movement)\nChanges in solar energy received by the earth due to slight changes in earth's orientation and distance from the sun\nVery long volcanic events\u00a0lasting millions of years\nShort\u00a0term changes from brief volcanic events and meteorite impacts\n\nThe cooling periods created huge sheets of ice that covered much of North America, Europe and Asia, and to a lesser extent the southern hemisphere. The current theory on the cause of ice ages relate\u00a0to changes in earth's tilt, distance from the sun, and the wobble of its axis.\u00a0All of these slowly change over tens of thousands of year and correlates very closely to when ice ages occur.\n\u00a0\n\nEnhanced warming of earth\u2019s lower atmosphere is affecting that natural cycle.\n\u201cModels predict that Earth will warm between 2 and 6 degrees Celsius in the next century. When global warming has happened at various times in the past two million years, it has taken the planet about 5,000 years to warm 5 degrees.
