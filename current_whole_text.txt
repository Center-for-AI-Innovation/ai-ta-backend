Cover crop incentive programs in Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, and Vermont were compared and farmers using cover crops were surveyed (n = 328) to characterize program participants and assess the effects of programs on cover crop adoption. Farmers who participated in incentive programs differed from nonparticipants in their perspectives about incentive programs, challenges they faced using cover crops, and reasons for cover crop use. When averaged across farmers, results show that incentive programs doubled average farmer cropland with cover crops from 50.7 ha prior to participation to 101.0 ha during participation. Among participants who no longer were enrolled in a program, cover crop use remained on average 37.2% greater than before enrollment. Results highlight the role of incentive programs in facilitating adoption and provide insights for expanding participation to different farmers and increasing program impact. 1 INTRODUCTION Cover crops are crops that are planted to provide on-farm benefits such as reduced soil erosion, improved soil health, pest control, nutrient cycling, and nitrogen fixation (Daryanto et al., 2018; Schipanski et al., 2014; Wood & Bowman, 2021). Cover crops also provide important off-farm benefits This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and no modifications or adaptations are made. 2023 The Authors.

Although many farm- ers recognize these benefits and cover crop use increased 50% between 2012 and 2017, adoption is still relatively low with only 5.1% of U.S. harvested cropland (excluding alfalfa) being planted to cover crops in 2017 (Wallander et al., 2021). Agric Environ Lett. 2023;8:e20114. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ael2 1 of 6 https://doi.org/10.1002/ael2.20114 2 of 6 CHAMI ET AL. Financial incentive programs that pay farmers to grow cover crops are increasingly common and can facilitate adop- tion among farmers (Myers et al., 2019). However, farmer participation in incentive programs can be affected by various factors (Maybery et al., 2005; Reimer et al., 2012), including farmer demographics and incentive program characteristics (Park et al., 2023; Pieiro et al., 2020). Programmatic bar- riers to farmer participation include perceived transaction costs. For example, in a survey of U.S. soybean farmers, nearly one third of respondents who did not participate in programs agreed that perceived transaction costs such as application requirements and documenting compliance were barriers (McCann & Claassen, 2016). Cover crop incentive programs are administered through federal, state, and county agencies and a variety of private and nongovernmental organizations. The USDA for exam- ple, offers cover crop incentives through the Environmental Quality Incentive Program and the Conservation Stewardship Program. Many states offer incentive programs to supplement federal programs. In 2017, state and federal programs dis- bursed $180 million in incentives for cover crops on 2 million ha, which was about one third of the cropland planted to cover crops in 2018 (Wallander et al., 2021). States in the northeastern United States have among the highest cover crop adoption rates in the nation and were among the states with the greatest increases in cover crop adoption between 2012 and 2017 (Wallander et al., 2021). In Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, and Vermont, the amount of cropland (excluding alfalfa) planted to cover crops increased by 24% (Maryland) to 115% (Vermont) from 2012 to 2017 (Wallander et al., 2021). In 2017, 32.6% of crop- land (excluding alfalfa) was cover cropped in Maryland, followed by 16.9% in Pennsylvania, 10.3% in Vermont, and 9.2% in New York, all of which are above the national aver- age of 5.1% (Wallander et al., 2021). These four states also differ in state-level cover crop incentive programs, with farm- ers in Maryland and Vermont having access to sustained financial support, farmers in New York being able to par- ticipate for 3 years, and farmers in Pennsylvania not having access to any state-level program. Between 2011 and 2018, the Maryland Agricultural Water Quality Cost-Share pro- gram was the largest with an average of 143,210 ha/year enrolled and an average annual budget of over $20 million. State programs in New York and Vermont were smaller and had a combined average enrolled area of only 3847 ha/year and a combined average annual budget of just under $500,000. To better understand how incentive programs influence cover crop adoption within a region, an online survey was con- ducted and targeted farmers in Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, and Vermont. Our objectives were to characterize farm- ers who have participated in programs and assess the effects of programs on cover crop adoption. Core Ideas An online survey was conducted to assess cover crop incentive program participants and program impact on adoption. Area planted with cover crops was greater during and after program participation compared to before program enrollment. Differences identified between program partici- pants and nonparticipants may be used to refine programs. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Survey The survey instrument was developed through an iterative process that included consultation with incentive program administrators. A pilot survey was distributed to farmers and revised accordingly. The final survey was anonymous and included questions about farm characteristics, use of cover crops, use of incentive programs, satisfaction with incentive programs, and demographics (Protocol ID # 1906008869). A combination of multiple choice, Likert scale, and open- ended questions was included. Logic functions were included so farmers who had used cover crops and had participated in programs were asked additional questions. Assistance with survey distribution was requested from program administra- tors, extension agents, and nongovernmental organizations in each state. The USDA Organic Integrity Database was also used to collect contact information and send farmers email messages asking for their participation. The online survey was conducted using Qualtrics and available from July 2019 to January 2020. 2.2 Data analysis A series of logistic regressions were conducted to assess the relationship between participating in an incentive program and each reason a farmer might use cover crops. Individual reasons were assessed separately to control for multicollinear- ity issues associated with a single logistic regression model including all reasons for adoption. Variables controlled for were years farming, farm size, livestock, gender, education, and state. Since years farming was highly correlated with age, we did not include age as a control variable. To quantify cover crop adoption rates among farmers who had used cover crops before enrolling in the incentive program, a StuartMaxwell test was used to assess the marginal homogeneity between the 24719625, 2023, 2, Downloaded from https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ael2.20114 by Readcube (Labtiva Inc.), Wiley Online Library on [23/08/2023].

The majority of farmers in our survey (54%) were 51 years or older, while the national average farmer age is 59 years (USDA, 2017). Average farm size among survey respondents (172 ha) was larger than the average reported for these states in the Census of Agriculture (69 ha) (USDA, 2019). The majority of respondents (58.7%) were organic farmers or operated farms that were both organic and conventional, and nearly half of the respondents (46.8%) grew vegetables. Disproportionately more organic farmers and vegetable farmers responded to our survey than would be expected based on the Census of Agriculture (USDA, 2017). More respondents in our survey partly (45.3%) or fully rented (11.5%) the land they farmed compared to respondents to the Census of Agriculture (25.5% and 5.6%, respectively) (USDA, 2017). 3.2 Participation in incentive programs A goal of this research was to characterize farmers who participate in cover crop incentive programs. Farmers who participated in programs (n = 142) differed from those who had not participated (n = 176) (Table 1). More farm- ers with >30 years of farming experience participated in cover crop incentive programs, whereas more inexperienced farmers (i.e., farming <10 years) did not participate in pro- grams (p < 0.001). More male than female or other farmers (p < 0.001) and more respondents with a high school degree only (p < 0.001) participated in programs. Farmers who par- ticipated in cover crop incentive programs tended to operate conventional rather than organic farms (p = 0.006; Table 1). Farm size also varied between program participants and non- participants, with participant farmers operating larger farms (i.e., mean of 304 ha for participants compared to 87 ha for nonparticipants; p < 0.001). Respondents with greater agreement with the statements incentive programs help farmers to protect the environment (p < 0.01; = 0.640), incentive programs allow farmers to test practices with less financial risk (p < 0.05; = 0.390), and the government should pay farmers to plant cover crops (p < 0.01; = 0.565) were more likely to have participated in a cover crop incentive program (Figure 1). Respondents with greater agreement with the statement incentive programs are too strict and participating in them is time-consuming (p < 0.01; = -0.292) were less likely to have participated in an incentive program. Respondents who reported that not enough time to fit into rotation (p < 0.05; = 0.626) was a challenge with cover crops were more likely to have par- ticipated in an incentive program (Figure 1), which could be related to incentive program planting deadlines. Golden (2021) also identified lack of incentive program flexibility (e.g., strict planting dates and limited species options) and perceived administrative burdens as top concerns in the west- ern United States. In our survey, respondents who reported that they used cover crops for improved water infiltration and storage (p < 0.01; = 0.828), increased soil organic matter (p < 0.01; = 1.159), and reduced soil erosion (p < 0.01; = 1.159) were more likely to have participated in an incentive program (Figure 1). 3.3 Program impact Incentive programs had a substantial impact on cover crop adoption. When averaged across farmers who participated in an incentive program (n = 130), cover cropped area increased from 50.7 ha prior to program participation to 101.0 ha while participating. Farmers who did not use cover crops before par- ticipating planted cover crops on an average of 89.0 ha during the period of program participation. For farmers who used cover crops before participation, cropland with cover crops also increased during program participation (2(3) = 16.9, p < 0.01). For example, farmers who were already using cover crops on at least 40 ha increased their average cropland with cover crops 52% from 158 to 240 ha during the period of program participation. Although we did not estimate addi- tionality (i.e., adoption that would not have occurred in the absence of incentive programs), previous research on cover crop incentive programs estimated additionality rates ranging from 54% in Iowa (Sawadgo & Plastina, 2021) to 91% in Ohio (Messatesta et al., 2013). Most respondents who had participated in an incentive program were still actively enrolled in a program when the survey was completed. However, a subset of farmers had stopped participating, allowing us to assess the legacy of program participation. Demographics of farmers who had stopped participating in an incentive program (n = 36) were not different (p > 0.05) than farmers who had participated in an incentive program (n = 142). When isolating responses from farmers who were no longer participating in a program (n = 36), results show that an average of 34.0 ha were planted prior to program enrollment, which increased to 55.8 ha while receiving financial incentives, and then decreased to 49.4 ha after the program concluded. Within this subset of farmers, average cover cropped area increased 55% during program enrollment relative to cover cropped area prior to 24719625, 2023, 2, Downloaded from https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ael2.20114 by Readcube (Labtiva Inc.), Wiley Online Library on [23/08/2023].

Interestingly, after incen- tive program participation concluded, cover cropped area was still 37.2% greater compared to cover cropped area prior to incentive program participation. Results suggest that although continuous financial support may maximize cover crop use, incentive programs that provide support for a limited dura- tion may have lasting effects and contribute to sustained adoption. While state incentive programs might be a strong driver of cover crop adoption, results from Pennsylvania show that other factors are also important. For example, in 2017, there were 240,913 ha planted to cover crops in Pennsylvania 24719625, 2023, 2, Downloaded from https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ael2.20114 by Readcube (Labtiva Inc.), Wiley Online Library on [23/08/2023].

The number of respondents (n) varied by statement and ranged from 294 to 297. When significant differences were present, an asterisk (*) indicates a p value between 0.01 and 0.05, double asterisks (**) indicate a p value between 0.001 and 0.01, and triple asterisks (***) indicate a p value between 0.0001 and 0.001. Odds ratios show the odds of participating in incentive programs based on agreeing with the statement versus not agreeing with the statement. Odds ratios falling to the right of the vertical line (i.e., >1) represent cases where respondents were more likely to have participated in a cover crop incentive program with greater agreement to the statement. Conversely, odds ratios falling to the left of the vertical line (i.e., <1) represent cases where respondents were less likely to have participated in a cover crop incentive program with greater agreement to the statement. accounting for 17% of the states cropland (excluding alfalfa). In 2017, Pennsylvania was ranked fourth in the country after Maryland (33%), Delaware (20%), and Connecticut (20%) in terms of cropland planted to cover crop (USDA, 2017). Given that Pennsylvania has high adoption but no state cover crop incentive program, it appears that high levels of adoption are attainable without state support. Thus, future research should consider sociocultural (e.g., farmer values and attitudes, access to technical support, political climate) and biophysical factors (e.g., soils, topography, climate) that enable or inhibit cover crop adoption. 4 CONCLUSION Incentive programs assessed in this study facilitated cover crop adoption, increased the area planted on farms where cover crops were already used, and resulted in elevated use even after incentive payments ended. We also found that cer- tain farmers were more likely to participate in cover crop programs, including experienced, male farmers with larger conventional farms. Evaluating participation is important for optimizing incentive programs and recruiting farmers who have been underrepresented in existing programs, including new and beginning farmers, women farmers, and farmers operating smaller farms and organic farms.
