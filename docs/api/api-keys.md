  Before you can start using the API, you need to generate an API key. This key
  is essential for authenticating your requests and ensuring secure
  communication with our services.

# API Keys

{% hint style="info" %}
We don't store your OpenAI keys when using our API. You must supply them for every request for security and simplicity. That way you're in control of costs and your key is never leaked.
{% endhint %}

Generating an API Key

To generate an API key, navigate to the API Key Management section in your user interface from Materials page.  Click on the "Generate API Key" button to create a new key. Once generated, you can copy the key to your clipboard by clicking the copy icon next to it. You can also copy the curl or language specific code blocks on the left section where your api key will be replaced automatically once you generate one. Please note that only admins of the project will be able to access this page for ensuring secured access to the API.

Note: You can have at max one API key at a time. Feel free to rotate it using the rotate key button or delete it if the need arises.
