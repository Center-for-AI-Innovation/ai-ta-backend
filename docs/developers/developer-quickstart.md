## Set up Infiscal for Environment Variables

{% hint style="warning" %}
You must setup an account before continuing, for our secrets service [Infisical](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/getting-started/introduction).\
Confirm you can login here: [https://env.uiuc.chat/](https://env.uiuc.chat/)
{% endhint %}

Instead of sharing `.env` files manually, we use Infiscal as a central password manager for devs. We use its CLI and web interface.

See the [CLI install docs](https://infisical.com/docs/cli/overview) for Linux/Windows instructions. Or the [CLI usage docs](https://infisical.com/docs/cli/usage).

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="brew" %}
```bash
# install
brew install infisical/get-cli/infisical
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="apt-get" %}
```bash
# add the repository
curl -1sLf \
'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/infisical/infisical-cli/setup.deb.sh' \
| sudo -E bash

# install
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y infisical
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Where are my `.env` variables?

If it's running on `localhost`, the env vars come from **Infisical**, our shared secrets manager. You can add new env vars at [env.uiuc.chat](https://env.uiuc.chat/)

If it's in production, or any cloud service, the env vars are stored directly in that cloud service. Those include Vercel, Railway, Beam.cloud and more. You can edit env vars in those services, just be careful.

## Frontend Setup

Frontend repo: [https://github.com/Center-for-AI-Innovation/uiuc-chat-frontend](https://github.com/Center-for-AI-Innovation/uiuc-chat-frontend)

```bash
# clone the repo somewhere good
git clone git@github.com:Center-for-AI-Innovation/uiuc-chat-frontend.git
```

<details>

<summary>❌ Seeing an error? git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).</summary>

If you see an error like this:&#x20;

```
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```

Then you have to **add your local `ssh`key to your Github account** here: [https://github.com/settings/keys](https://github.com/settings/keys)

Finally, attempt cloning the repo again.

</details>

### (1/2) Install dev dependencies

{% hint style="warning" %}
follow these instructions _**in order;**_ it's tested to work brilliantly.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Use Node version `18.xx` LTS

```bash
# check that nvm is installed (any version). 
# easily install here: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating
nvm --version 

# use node version 18
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
node --version  # v18.20.4
```

Install dev dependencies

```bash
# navigate to the root of the github
cd uiuc-chat-frontend

# install all necessary dependencies 
npm i 
```

### (2/2) Set up secrets

```bash
# navigate to the root of the github
cd uiuc-chat-frontend

infisical login
# ⭐️ --> select "Self Hosting"
# ⭐️ --> enter "https://env.uiuc.chat"
# ⭐️ click the login link
# ⭐️ likely enter your main computer password
```

### Last step: start dev server!&#x20;

You will need to run the below command once for the initial setup

```bash
# Use our linter, Trunk SuperLinter. 
# Just run the commande below once to install it.
# Now every `git commit` and `git push` will trigger linting.
# We suggest accepting the auto-formatting suggestions.

npm exec trunk check
```

Run the app on your local machine

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong># run server with secrets &#x26; live reload
</strong># as defined in package.json, this actually runs: infisical run --env=dev -- next dev
npm run dev

# you should see a log of the secrets being injected
INF Injecting 32 Infisical secrets into your application process
...
  ▲ Next.js 13.5.6
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000
  
# cmd + click on the URL to open your browser :) 
</code></pre>

`npm run dev` is the most important command you'll use every dev session.

***

## Backend Setup

Backend repo: [https://github.com/Center-for-AI-Innovation/ai-ta-backend](https://github.com/Center-for-AI-Innovation/ai-ta-backend)

```bash
# clone the repo somewhere good
git clone git@github.com:Center-for-AI-Innovation/ai-ta-backend.git
```

<details>

<summary>❌ Seeing an error? git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).</summary>

If you see an error like this:&#x20;

```
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```

Then you have to **add your local `ssh`key to your Github account** here: [https://github.com/settings/keys](https://github.com/settings/keys)

Finally, attempt cloning the repo again.

</details>

### (1/2) Install dev dependencies

Use a python virtual environment, here I'll use `conda`.

* [Fast and easy conda install](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/install#macos-linux-installation) (via CLI is easiest), if you don't have it yet.

Use <mark style="color:yellow;">python 3.10</mark>.

1. Create and activate Conda env

```bash
conda create --name ai-ta-backend python=3.10 -y && conda activate ai-ta-backend
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
# navigate to the root of the github
cd ai-ta-backend

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### (2/2) Set up secrets

{% hint style="warning" %}
You must setup an account before continuing, for our secrets service [Infisical](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/getting-started/introduction).\
Confirm you can login here: [https://env.uiuc.chat](https://env.uiuc.chat/)

Also make sure to install Infiscal in your local machine as mentioned above
{% endhint %}

<pre><code># navigate to the root of the github
cd path/to/ai-ta-backend
<strong>infisical login
</strong># ⭐️ --> select "Self Hosting"
# ⭐️ --> enter "https://env.uiuc.chat"
# ⭐️ click the login link
# ⭐️ likely enter your main computer password

</code></pre>

### Last step: start dev server!

```bash
# start dev server on localhost:8000
infisical run --env=dev -- flask --app ai_ta_backend.main:app --debug run --port 8000
```

Now you can write new endpoints in `ai-ta-backend/main.py` and call them using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).&#x20;
