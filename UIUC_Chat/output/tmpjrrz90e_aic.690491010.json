These heuristics are based on the ''attraction'' that exists between neighboring stationary points and the resulting distortion of the level curves that give rise to valleys, ridges, as well as the general curvature of the least-squares landscape. For example, the direction of the attraction between the local minimum, saddle point, and solution shown in Figure 1 correspond to the eigenvectors associated with the smallest positive eigenvalue at either the local minimum or solution and the largest negative eigenvalue at the saddle point.

In particular, Lucia and Feng provide considerable details for an algebraic implementation of a terrain method in which downhill movement takes place using an algebraic equation solver like a trust region method and uphill exploration is conducted using a predictor-corrector method. Predictor steps can be uphill Newton or approximate second-order Newton steps, while corrector steps, which return iterates to a valley or ridge if they have wandered too far, result from the intermittent solution of the optimization problem defined in Eq. 1 using successive quadratic programming. Rapid convergence to singular or saddle points is accomplished using quadratic acceleration. Both uphill and downhill movement results in the determination of a stationary point or a collision with a boundary of the feasible region. Because stationary points are really only connected to neigh-boring stationary points along specific eigendirections, only a few eigenvalues and eigenvectors are needed to initiate movement to find the next stationary point. Moreover, this limited connectedness is easily implemented using linked-list concepts and can be used to determine when the algorithm has finished.

First, it is important to understand that Figure 2 is a solid object, where the outer cage-like surface represents the largest level of F T F which, for the given parameter set, has a value of F T F s150. Thus, as one moves inward and orthogonal to the surface, the value of the level decreases. That is, each specific level encloses all lower levels. Second, the darker circular or elliptical regions of Figure 2 simply represent the intersection of the level surfaces with boundaries of the feasible region, which were set to y7F x, y F 7 and 0 F z F15 for this illustration. Third, the two upper lobes of the figure are twisted about the torso. The lobe on the right comes out of the page, while the lobe on the left goes into the page.

Therefore, to provide a more convincing illustration of connectedness we show a 3-D relief map of the level curves of F T F in Figure 3 . This relief map is simply a cut-away and clearly shows the connectedness of the stationary point of the steady-state Lorenz equations. Note that the integral curves connecting the solutions and saddle points pass directly through the collection of minima of g T g on the set of level curves shown in Figure 3 .

Figure 5 shows the path connecting the pure IPA vertex, the pure water vertex, the IPA-H O azeotropic solution, and the 2 two saddle points between the pure component vertices and the binary azeotropic solution that was generated by our terrain method. Note that there is a pair of tangent bifurcations in the integral curves near the pure water vertex and hysteresis in the path, as indicated by the small set of level curves common to both branches of the path. the values of F T F are 0.18086 and 0.14514, respectively. However, it is important to note that these tangent bifurcations do not affect the connectedness between the stationary points in this problem and our terrain method easily finds all stationary points irrespective of which stationary point is found first! Figure 6 gives a complete summary of the numerical results of our terrain methodology applied to the problem of finding all azeotropes for the ternary heterogeneous mixture of NPBrIPArH O at 6.66612=10 4 Pa. Note that 13 station-2 ary points were located. More importantly, the integral curves that connect all azeotropes were correctly determined and all four azeotropes shown in Table 6 were successfully calculated using 472 function and gradient calls and 2.58 s of computer time.",
