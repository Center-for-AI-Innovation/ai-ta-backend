Conceptual design of a process covers that stage in the evolution of a final design where enough information is at hand to enable reliable estimates of capital and operating costs. Such estimates are often used to obtain capital appropriations from company management. It is different from final design, where specifications are exact enough to enable equipment purchasing and construction to begin. Another point to be made: distillation systems includes more than just the columns, that is, heat exchangers, pumps, controls, and the like. In a sense, the authors might have used \"columns\" in the title instead of \"systems.\" Emphasis here is only on the column, singly or in tandem with other columns.",

For unusual or poorly known systems, the user will have to go to the supporting references to develop VLE model parameters. More likely, the user will obtain the parameters from a simulation program. The latter part of the chapter covers equilibrium flash calculations and the concepts are developed in how they might be combined to form a multistage distillation column. It is clear that the authors assume that the user has available a process simulator, whether commercial or in-house, a quite reasonable assumption these days.",

Extensive use is made of residue maps for ternary mixtures and, to some extent, quaternary mixtures. The use of the Fenske-Underwood-Gilliland method for multicomponent mixtures is given adequate attention. Again, the user is left on his or her own regarding the use of simulators for multicomponent mixtures.",

This chapter and a later one (8) o n heterogeneous azeotropic distillation occupy a large portion of the book, a result more of the intellectual intrigue of the methodology than of the proportion of actual problems encountered in practice. Surprisingly, the coverage of commonly-practiced extractive distillation is slight, and is limited to the use of an entrainer to separate close-boiling azeotropic mixtures. The separation of close-boiling nonazeotropes should have been mentioned, as well as the approximate methods for handling such mixtures on a solvent-free basis. The extensive coverage of azeotropic distillation appears justified because of the paucity of coverage of the methodology in other references.",

As mentioned earlier, it can also serve the needs of practitioners, especially those with, or serving, companies producing high-valued specialty chemicals. Coverage of extractive distillation, particularly related to solvent selection, could be added. The book does not cover all elements of the \"system\" as normally defined, but rather is confined to the most challenging and economically important part of the system, the column. The writing is clear and has a bit of style not always found in scientific textbooks. The book is recommended to those with the interests indicated above.",
