This variation is illustrated in Figure 5 for a smooth disk, together with the pure water flux corresponding to a permeability of 260 L h y1 m y2 bar y1 . The permeate flux reaches a plateau at a TMP of 400 kPa for all speeds above 1,000 rpm and at 300 kPa at 1,000 rpm. This plateau increases from 63 L h y1 m y2 at 1,000 rpm to 141 L h y1 m y2 at 2,500 rpm.

However, in order to eliminate the effect of initial fouling noticed in Figure 4 , the first 90 min of tests were carried out at initial concentration by recycling the permeate. In addition, during the first 5 min of filtration, the retentate valve was kept open, then it was shut progressively to reach the desired TMP to minimize initial fouling. After 90 min, the permeate recirculation was stopped and the concentration phase was started until the retentate volume became equal to the dead volume in order to reach values since they are not in the mass-transfer limited regime, as it can be inferred from Figure 5 . The mass-transfer coefficients K at these two pressures are, respectively, 49.8 and 56.3 L h y1 m y2 . The corresponding maximum VRR obtained by extrapolation to J s 0 are 7.2 and 6.7. The variation of permeate flux with concentration was markedly different \u017d . when a 6-mm vanes disk was fitted in the module Figure 12 . Not only permeate fluxes were higher than with the smooth disk, but they remain practically constant until a VRR of 3, because they correspond to a pressure limited regime, as seen from Figure 6 for VRRs1. Therefore, Eq. 5 only applies at VRR larger than 3 with mass-transfer coefficients of 110 and 105 L h y1 m y2 at TMP of 200 and 300 kPa, respectively. The results of a concentration test performed with the large module and a disk equipped with 2-mm vanes at a TMP of 800 kPa are represented in Figure 13 . The variation of permeate flux with VRR is similar to that obtained with the small module showing a slow decay with concentration until VRR s 2. The permeate flux during this phase is higher than those of the smaller module even with a 6-mm vanes disk. Above VRRs 2, the permeate flux is mass-transfer limited and decays faster than for the small module. Consequently, the theoretical maximum VRR obtained by extrapolation to zero flux drops to 6.2 vs. 9.2 for the small module with a 6-mm vanes disk. This different behavior may be due to the higher pressure, 800 kPa instead of 300 since mean shear rates are almost the same in both modules in these conditions, as seen from Figure 3 .",

Calculation of the shear stress in the presence of vanes would require the use of \u017d . computing fluid dynamics CFD software, which was beyond the scope of this investigation. So, it was encouraging to find that the permeate fluxes obtained on using various types of disks and two different sizes modules were well correlated by a function of the same power of the membrane shear rate, using appropriate velocity coefficients for each type of disk. This result led us to postulate that mean membrane shear \u017d . rate or stress is the main parameter governing permeate flux in these systems and details of internal flows are less important. If this simple result also holds for larger sizes than our prototypes, it would greatly simplify the design of industrial scale systems using Eq. 2b. This equation shows that increasing rotation speed has a slightly stronger effect than increasing the radius, because shear rate increases as 1.8 r 1.6 for same disk azimuthal velocity. In addition, larger diameter devices will present a more inhomogeneous permeate flux because of larger relative variations in shear rate between center and periphery. gram Prosetia and by the Regional Council of Picardy.
