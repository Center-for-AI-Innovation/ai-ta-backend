Maximization of the log-likelihood function in this approach is equivalent to weighted nonlinear least-squares \u017d . WNLS . This involves minimization of a quadratic form in \u017d . the residuals Aitken, 1935 , in which the weight given to each possible product of residuals at a particular design point is an element of the reciprocal variance\u1390covariance matrix for the responses. If there is only one response, or if correlations between the responses are neglected, this quadratic form reduces to a weighted sum of squared residuals. The basic problem that arises in all WNLS is that of estimating the variance\u1390covariance matrix. In the absence of replicate measurements, the covariances are estimated by means of an error-propagation formula based on a Taylor-series expansion, application of which to activity-coefficient data was first de-\u017d . scribed by Ulrichson and Stevenson 1972 . WNLS treatments can be classified according to a hierarchy of approximations made in the treatment of the covariances. The most rigorous treatments allow for both heteroscedasticity and correlated responses, and require estimates of the covariance matrix at each design point. Less rigorous treatments assume the covariance matrix to be the same for all data; the sim-\u017d plest approximation the diagonal uniform weighting approxi-. mation assumes that the weighting matrices are all propor-\u017d . tional to the identity matrix. As discussed by Bard 1974 and \u017d . Bates and Watts 1988, Chap. 4 , application of ML theory in situations where the covariances are unknown requires minimization of the determinant of the moment matrix of residu-\u017d . als Box and Draper, 1965 . The alternative approach, which has been adopted much less widely, is to fit the calculated pressure-composition curves directly to the data, without prior calculation of the activity coefficients at each experimental composition. Here, the ML method is equivalent to minimization of a weighted sum of squared residuals for all the data, subject to vectors of functional constraints containing the activity coefficients derived from the excess Gibbs energy model. Such generalized non-\u017d . linear least squares GNLS calculations can be carried out by use of Gauss-Newton algorithms developed by Britt and \u017d . \u017d .\u017d . Luecke 1973 and Jefferys 1980 BLJ for a single vector of \u017d . functional constraints, and by Anderson et al. 1978 for two vectors of constraints. These ''errors-in-variables'' or ''random-regressor'' approaches rely on fewer assumptions concerning the covariances of the variables, but suffer from the disadvantage of being complex and requiring good initial parameter estimates for convergence.",

Such a phenomenon is particularly likely at the extremes of the composition range.

This seems reasonable; in the determinant method, no attempt is made to limit the influence of the dilute-solution data by assignment of multiplicative weights. A striking consequence of this is the difference in the extrapolated activity coefficients at infinite dilution, particularly for \u2425 : 3.6 as compared with about 3.2.

But considering that the likelihood contour shapes reflect the combined effects of the precision of the data, the number of points, and the sensitivity of the model to the parameter values and the variables, they seem to be of limited value in illustrating the distinction between the present approach and conventional WNLS or GNLS. Of far more practical importance in this regard is the manner in which the influence of the dilutesolution VLE data on parameter estimates is taken into account. When the determinant criterion is used, no differential weighting is applied to the data; in WNLS, deemphasis of the dilute-solution data is achieved through assumed values of the variances of the activity-coefficient data, while in the present approach the same effect is achieved more rigorously by specifying the precision of the individual vapor and liquid compositions.

Although the present analysis follows a closely similar argument and is founded on statistical assumptions that are essentially equivalent, it cannot be regarded as an errors-in-variables model in sensu stricto, because the mean values used in setting up the log-likelihood function are fixed equal to the experimental data. In this regard it parallels more closely the VLE data-reduction scheme proposed by Kemeny \u017d . et al. 1982 , which is based on the ''effective variance'' approximation.

These effects are much better treated by direct GNLS analysis of VLE data. Considering that in low-pressure VLE data these effects are often \u017d small and largely cancel each other Smith and Van Ness, . 1987, p. 347 , this limitation is unlikely to be particularly serious in many practical situations. In any event, the ML method should provide good initial parameter estimates for GNLS calculations. The two approaches are therefore best regarded as complementary rather than as mutually exclusive alternatives. Parameter estimation involving the least-squares analysis of activity coefficients has the advantage of being able to reveal systematic trends indicative of incompatibility between the excess Gibbs energy model and the data. The same observation applies a fortiori to the present theory: by eliminating the need for the generally unknown covariance matrix at each point, the amount of useful information that can be extracted from the composition dependence of activity coefficients has been considerably increased \u138fparticularly for data containing appreciable scatter. A particularly important attribute of the present ML method is that it provides a theoretically valid basis for extrapolation of partition ratios to very low concentrations, where methods based on correlation of g E rRTX X can fail badly. The possible application to analysis of gas-solubility data and isopiestic equilibration experiments has already been mentioned. A further practical problem where such extrapolations are of importance is in the vapor\u1390liquid partitioning of electrolytes from aqueous solutions at high temperatures \u017d . Marshall et al., 2000; Palmer et al., 1999a,b . This has been recognized for many years as an important cause of corrosion in the steam cycles of fossil-fuel and nuclear power stations. Traces of electrolyte impurities that are completely dissociated under ambient conditions become strongly associated as \u017d neutral molecules or ion pairs at high temperatures as the . dielectric constant of the water solvent decreases , and therefore susceptible to volatilization. Measurements of such va-por\u1390liquid transfer are inherently difficult, and rely on the determination of extremely small concentrations\u138fmeasurements of the equilibrium partitioning quotients contain considerable scatter. It is usually required to extract from such data an estimate of the inherent volatility of the electrolyte \u017d . in effect, a molal Henry's law constant by adopting a suitable activity-coefficient model for the aqueous phase and extrapolating to infinite dilution.

                "text": "The problem of fitting experimental partition ratio data to theoretical models has been solved by a ML parameter estimation procedure, based on the exact distribution function for the ratio of two random variables described by truncated normal distributions. For the case of a single solute obeying Henry's law, this distribution function can be expressed in terms of error-function integrals. The most important advantage of the proposed procedure in comparison with conventional least-squares fitting procedures is that knowledge of the mean and variance is not required: these are undefined, as is also true for the well-known case of the ratio of two normally distributed random variables. The joint distribution function for the vapor\u1390liquid partition ratios of each component in a binary mixture can be derived by application of the change-of-variable rule for multivariate distribution functions. ML fits of activity coefficients based on this joint distribution function allow experimental uncertainties to be more rigorously taken into account in the estimation of infinite-dilution activity coefficients. Possible applications to the analysis of isopiestic experiments and modeling of VLE in electrolytes at high temperatures have been identified.",
