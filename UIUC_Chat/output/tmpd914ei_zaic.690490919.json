In many of these applications, unwanted formation of foam can take place, which leads to a reduction in working volume, loss of product, fouling of sensors, and limitation in aeration rate. Therefore, foam control is an important issue. In most cases, foaming occurs unexpectedly and irregularly in time. Therefore, it is very important to have the possibility of anticipating the foaming and to avoid all the problems associated with excessive foaming. \u017d Many research reports discuss foam control for example, Kunii et al., 1994; Takesono et al., 1994; Guitian and Joseph, . 1998, Deshpande and Barigou, 2000 , but to our best knowledge, no information is available in literature about the early detection of foam formation.",

Figure 2 shows the S-values for pressure fluctuation measurements at 0.53 m together with pictures of the top of the column at several ethanol concentrations. It can be seen that only at the highest concentration serious foaming takes place. However, the monitoring method already exceeds the value three at much lower values. This indicates that the hydrodynamics already changes before foaming gives serious problems.",

Figure 3 shows that already at low ethanol concentrations the S-value becomes larger than three. The change is sharper than in the homogeneous regime and the concentration where the change appears is lower. Again, the pressure drop does not clearly indicate a change in the hydrodynamics. Figure 3 shows that the pressure signals measured at 0.33 m yield the most sensitive S-values. This result was duplicated in various experiments; it was checked that it was not due to a difference in the sensors. Up to now, we do not yet have a clear explanation for the difference in the result for different measurement height. When the concentration of ethanol reaches 0.05 grL, the S-value becomes larger than three, although no foam layer is yet visible. Therefore, we conclude that the monitoring method can be used as an early warning indicator for foam formation both in the homogeneous and the heterogeneous regime.",
