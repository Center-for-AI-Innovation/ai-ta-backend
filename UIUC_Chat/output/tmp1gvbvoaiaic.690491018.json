The data in the latter work indicate a constant selectivity provided Re) 20,000 for both large and small tanks, as shown in Figure 1 . For additional information, see \u017d . the work of Bourne and Yu 1994 , who demonstrate similar selectivity profiles in stirred tanks for similar values of the Damkohler number when the tank volume was increased by a factor of 30, with the feed position fixed near the impeller discharge. Some scatter in their experimental data was evident, however, for a feed position in the suction region of the impeller. In the latter case, the principle of local isotropy along a streamline is likely to be disturbed by the action of the impeller.",

For Re-Re the scale is the viscous or Kolmogoroff time defined c by Eq. 9, while for Re) Re , the mixing time is the inertial c value defined in Eq. 15.A comparison of both scales is demonstrated in Figure3for a tank reactor. The values of the flow ratio of pumping capacity-to-reactant feed indicate that an increase in impeller \u017d speed shifts the mixing scale from the Kolmogoroff micro-. \u017d . mixing to the inertial mesomixing value at the transition Reynolds number Re s 45,000.
