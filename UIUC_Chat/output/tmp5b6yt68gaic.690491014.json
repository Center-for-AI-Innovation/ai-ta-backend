However, these property correlations were based upon measured process operating conditions andror the parameters that describe MWD, and not the ac-\u017d . tual distribution. Ariawan et al. 2001 demonstrated that it is often more useful to consider the whole of the MWD curve when correlating the effect of molecular structure to the rhe-ology of the polymer. This is especially true when the MWD is skewed. Often extra concentrations of molecules in the high-or low-end regions of the MWD can result in significantly different rheological and processing behaviors. In Ari-\u017d . awan et al. 2001 it was found that extensional and elastic properties of the resins were dependent on the concentration of larger molecules, and in particular, on the tails in MWD at the high end.",

Using the Weight Fraction of Polymer in a Gi\u00aeen Molecu-\u017d . lar-Weight Range the binning method . From a fundamental process understanding, it is thought that relative proportions of the polymer between particular molecular weights have an influence on polymer resin and end-use properties. For example, MI is primarily influenced by higher molecular weights because MI is being measured at a low shear rate. However, in the case of STR it would be expected that it would be influenced by both high and low molecular weights, as it is a ratio of viscosity at a low shear rate to that at a high shear rate. Unfortunately, it is not known exactly which points on the MWD should be considered. However, these points could be determined using a two-tier optimization approach. ties, the differences in area from one ''bin'' to the next could be used as an indicator of variations in resin and end-use properties. While it may be possible to correlate a single bin to the end-use property in situations where the breadth of the MWD is constant, for the dual-reactor operation, the MWD made in each reactor can be changed to deliberately change the breadth of the overall distribution. Since the breadth is no longer constant, more than one bin may be required to predict the end-use polymer property. Conse-\u017d quently, n bin areas, A , . . . , A are considered where the 1 n value of n is determined so as to obtain a minimum predic-. tion error . Two parameters are used in order to obtain the bin areas: the bin center and width. This then allows the calculation of the appropriate areas, A , . . . , A .

A potential drawback of this strategy is that the training of the network is an iterative procedure, as is the bin specification. A rigorous strategy would therefore involve the training of a FANN for each iteration of the bin algorithm to find both the optimum bin centers and widths as well as network weights. As this would involve excessive computation, a compromise was adopted by utilizing the same ideas adopted by \u017d . Wold et al. 1989 in the formulation of the ''quick and dirty'' PLS algorithm. Thus, it is assumed that the bins determined from the linear model are the same as those that should be \u017d adopted for the nonlinear model with quick-and-dirty PLS, the linear latent variable projections are used with nonlinear . inner models . This may compromise the quality of the relationships developed, as the ideal bin positions are not necessarily the same for the linear and nonlinear algorithms, and may lead to a suboptimal solution. However, while being suboptimal, this should give an indication of whether benefits would be found by adopting the nonlinear model structure.",

It is interesting to observe that while the bins method selects a narrow region of the MWD as being descriptive of changes in MI, PLS makes use of a significant proportion of the distribution. This is apparent in Figure 7b , where the normalized projection input weights for the three latent variables are shown. Because a significant proportion of the normalized weights used in the regression are nonzero, a considerable number of points that make up the MWD are being used for prediction.",

The log transforms were taken because the linear methods could not cope with the system nonlinearity, but the nonlinear versions of the algorithm should not suffer from the same problem. It can be seen that for the case of the single reactor, the nonlinear bins method provides results with almost identical rms errors to that of the log-transformed MI bins. The only benefit arising from the nonlinear algorithm would be if an appropriate transformation for MI was not known. The results for the PLS algorithm demonstrate one of the pitfalls of using nonlinear models. In model construction, it is difficult to avoid problems such as overtraining and data extrapolationrinterpolation, and this can potentially result in degradation in behavior beyond that experienced with a linear model. This seems to be true for the nonlinear PLS results, since the testing errors are higher than the training errors. While the same pitfalls could potentially affect the nonlinear bins algorithm, the testing and training errors are very similar. The focus of nonlinear bins on a narrow, particularly descriptive range of the MWD, rather than the whole distribution, may be why it performs better on new data.",

The Dart Impact tests for polymer produced in the dual reactor were carried out with two different extruders. The possibility of including an extruder-type indicator in the model was investigated, and the results were disappointing. Around 20% of the data were gathered with the first extruder. It was therefore decided to eliminate this information from the data set and accept that the model would only be applicable for the second extruder. Even when considering data generated using the second extruder, changes in extruder operating policy were implemented over the course of the data-gathering exercise. The extruder conditions were included as additional inputs for the Dart Impact model.

MWD of a polymer is one of the more important quality-control variables in industrial processes, as end-use properties are dependent upon MWD. However, direct control of MWD is a difficult task. MWD is not measured on-line, and off-line indicators such as MI can be delayed by on the order of one the reactor temperatures and conversions along with resin characteristics such as MWD and comonomer incorporation.

MacGregor and Kourti 1995 provide a more detailed tutorial of these techniques, applied to \u017d . an industrial polymerization process. Gallagher et al. 1996 also present a good review of the technique with application to a nuclear-waste-vitrification process. PLS has been used by several researchers for the analysis of distributions. The normal objective is to correlate distribution information to product quality parameters. For instance, Harthun et al. \u017d . 1997 applied PLS to NIR spectrum to analyze for protein \u017d . concentration in a bioreactor. Lee and Chung 1998 used NIR spectroscopy for the rapid and nondestructive analysis of ethylene content in flake and pellet propylenerethylene copolymer. Using PLS combined with a second derivative algorithm, relevant spectral information was successfully ex-\u017d . tracted and correlated with a conventional infrared IR \u017d . method. Seasholtz 1999 presents four case studies on the application of NIR and NMR spectroscopy. Chemometric methods used included multivariate calibration with PLS and pattern recognition."
