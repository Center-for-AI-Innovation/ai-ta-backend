                "text": ". Aqueous solutions of N-methyldiethanolamine MDEA \u017d . and piperazine PIPH are widely used for selectively re-2 moving hydrogen sulfide from gaseous effluents containing \u017d . carbon dioxide such as natural gases . In such amine solu-\u017d . tions, the sour gases are physically and predominantly chemically absorbed. The selectivity is mainly due to large differences in chemical-reaction rates andror mass-transfer rates. In order to design the separation equipment, a model \u017d for describing the thermodynamic equilibrium that is, chemi-. cal and phase equilibrium is required, as deviation from equilibrium provides the driving force in a kinetically controlled process. \u017d In previous work Kuranov et al., 1996 ; Perez-Salado . Kamps et al., 2001 , a thermodynamic model is extended for describing the solubility of the single gases carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide in aqueous MDEA solutions was developed. The model parameters were based on experimental \u017d data on the protonation constant of MDEA Perez-Salado . Kamps and Maurer, 1996 , and on gas solubility data covering a temperature range from 313 K to 413 K. MDEA molality range is up to 8 mol per kilogram of water, and the pressure range is up to about 8 MPa. More recently, a model for describing the solubility of hydrogen sulfide in aqueous solutions of piperazine, based on experimental results at temperatures between 313 K and 393 K, piperazine molalities up to 4 mol per kilogram of water, and pressures up to about 9 \u017d . MPa has been developed Xia et al., 2003 . In the present contribution, the model is extended for describing the solubility of carbon dioxide in aqueous solutions of piperazine. The model is based, on the one hand, on recently published results for the chemical equilibrium constants for the formation of piperazine carbamate, piperazine \u017d dicarbamate, and protonated piperazine Ermatchkov et al., 2003 , and on the other hand, on new experimental solubility data at temperatures between 313 K and 393 K, piperazine molalities up to 4 mol per kilogram of water, and pressures up to about 9.6 MPa.",

Because the experimental phase-equilibrium database on this system is very limited, it is very difficult to identify and exclude inconsistent data, and it is not possible to reliably determine up-to-now neglected interaction parameters.

In such cases, it was assumed that the temperature was 293.15 K, and new experimental data for the density of aqueous solutions of MDEA and piperazine were used to convert molarities into molalities. In this concentration region molecular piperazine may have an essential influence on the very low vapor pressure of the mixture. Nevertheless, as can be seen from Figure 6 , model predictions for the partial pressure of carbon dioxide agree well with the experimental results by Bishnoi and Rochelle \u017d . 2000 . The average relative deviation between experiment and prediction amounts to 22%, but no systematic deviation is observed.",
