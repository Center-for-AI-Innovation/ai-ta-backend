It is a very frequent separation process in the pharmaceutical industry and in the wastewater units. A comprehensive review of the computer-aided analysis, optimal design, and control of batch distillation was published by \u017d . Kim and Diwekar 2001 . The simplest and most frequently used batch-distillation configuration is the rectifier. For the more sophisticated configurations, such as the middle-vessel column, very few experimental results have been published. Although in the last few years several theoretical studies have tackled the feasibility, Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to P. Lang. performance, optimal operation, and control of the batch ex-\u017d tractive distillation in conventional Mujtaba, 1999; Ahon and . de Medeiros, 2001 and nonconventional column configuraw tions such as in middle-vessel column, Safrit and Westerberg \u017d . \u017d . 1997 , Cheong and Barton 1999a,b,c , Warter and Stichlmair \u017d . \u017d . \u017d . 1999 , Phimister and Seider 2000 , Low and Sorensen 2002 , \u017d . x and in the inverted batch column, Dussel and Warter 2000 , \u00a8\u017d . to our knowledge, batch extractive distillation BED experimental results have been published so far only for the rectiw \u017d . \u017d . fier for example, Yatim et al. 1993 , Lelkes et al. 1998a , \u017d .x Milani 1999 . This indicates that before the industrial application of these configurations several practical problems must be still solved. By our former BED experiences with continu-\u017d ous entrainer feeding much better results Lang et al., 1994;  . Lang et al., 2000b can be obtained than by the batch addition of E. \u017d . Bernot et al. 1990 Bernot et al. , 1991 developed a simple method to predict the behavior, the feasibility, and the separation sequence of multicomponent batch distillation. Lelkes et al. \u017d . 1998b suggested a method for the assessment of the feasibility of the BED when applying continuous feeding of the homogeneous entrainer for the separation of minimum \u017d . azeotropes. Lang et al. 2000a extended this method for the BED separation of maximum azeotropes.",
