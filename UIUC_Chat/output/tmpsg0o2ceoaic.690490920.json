                "text": "Dept. of Chemical Engineering, Lamar University, Beaumont, TX 77710 Chemical processes are often operated under high pressures, at high temperatures, and with fast material flows and complex manufacturing mechanisms. Thus, their operation is always more risky, environmentally more harmful, and potentially more dangerous than other types of manufacturing activities when abnormal or destructive situations arise. In the extreme, catastrophes, such as explosions, toxic release, and loss of life, will occur unexpectedly and rapidly, particularly when a premeditated attack is made by an adversary who has sufficient technical background on chemical operations. Obviously, such security-threatening situations must be detected early, the potential impacts on production must be precisely evaluated, and operational solutions must be quickly derived. However, systematic and effective methodologies are not available for the chemical process industries today. Scientists and engineers are greatly challenged to swiftly develop a knowledge base of process security that can fundamentally help the industry perform process-security analysis, assess-\u017d ment, and improvement Margiloff, 2001; Cunningham, 2002;  . Ragan et al., 2002 . Process security is an extended concept and practice of process safety.

The scientific tools for safety enhancement are mainly probability analysis and logical reasoning about the root causes of adverse conditions.

To avoid any severe consequence, a fast and accurate assessment and a timely and effective action are the must-have requirements.
