It should be pointed out that answers to the questions can help to build correct mathematical models of catalytic processes that are highly nonlinear and coupled.

Unfortunately it is a rather hard problem to solve, although the key-component concept and the Prater relationship, which relates the temperature and concentration profiles, can make the task easier. However, the aim of this work can be achieved without finding an exact solution, by assuming parabolic profiles of reagents andror temperature. But this simple assumption is complicated due to internal diffusion. It is common knowledge that for small and medium internal diffusion resistance, reagent concentrations, and in consequence reaction rate in an active part of a \u017d . catalyst pellet, are positive cf. curve 1 in Figure 1 . Thus, the \u017d reaction zone that is, the area for which a reaction rate is . significant is equal to the active part of the catalyst pellet. As diffusional resistances grow, the reagent concentration in \u017d the active part drops cf. curve 2, for which the concentration . drops to null at r s R , and finally the reaction zone narnc \u017d rows cf. in curve 3, the resistance is significant, and R repc . resents the position of the hypothetical reaction interface .",
