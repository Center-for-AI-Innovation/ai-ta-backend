The onset of luteolysis is marked by the appearance of structurally complex autophagic vacuoles, one of which has not been described previously in luteal cells. This autophagic vacuole seems to originate from GERL (Golgi-endoplasmic reticulum-lysosomes) as a cup-shaped structure, which subsequently increases in size and complexity. Regressing luteal cells also contain increased numbers of both dense bodies (lysosomes) and lipid droplets, and exhibit changes in nuclear and mitochondria1 morphology. In contrast to previous reports in the literature, changes in the morphology of smooth ER were not observed as a characteristic feature of involution in corpora lutea of guinea pigs in the present study. Advanced regression of luteal cells is characterized by multiple fusion of lipid droplets and a decrease in the amount of smooth ER.",

Although the degeneration of luteal cells has been described for a number of mammalian species, the mechanisms underlying this normal involution are still imperfectly understood.

In addition, a1 though several fine structural studies have shown that autophagic vacuoles appear within luteal cells a t the time of regression, the origin of these vacuoles remains controversial. Several organelles have been implicated as the source of the membranes that enclose autlDphagic vacuoles in various tissues, including the Golgi complex (Frank and Christenslen, '68; Locke and Sykes, '751 , smooth endoplaiimic reticulum (Novikoff and Shin, '64; Arstila and Trump, '68) , GERL (Golgi-endoplasmic reticulum-lysosomes) (Novikoff, '64) and plasma membrane (van Lennep and Madden, '65; Quatacker, '71). Thus, it is evident that the involution of the corpus luteum deserves further attention. A careful fine structural analysis of regression in optimally preserved corpus luteum, followed by the cytochemical localization of appropriate marker enzymes, e.g., acid phosphatase, a lysosomal enzyme, should yield insight into how luteal cells degenerate. However, both fine structural and cytochemical studies are hampered by the fact that steroid-secreting cells are difficult to prepare for electron microscopy. The method used to fix the tissue has a profound effect on the quality of' preservation, especially that of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (smooth ER). Steroid-secreting cells when fixed by immersion generally show considerable variation in the preservation of cellular fine structure and often contain vesicular smooth ER. On the other hand, perfusion of the fixative through steroid-secreting tissues produces consistently superior morphology, and the smootlh ER is usually maintained in its characteristic tubular or cisternal form (Christensen, '65) . In order to obtain optimally fixed material for this study, a method was developed that allows corpora lutea to be fixed in situ by perfusion of the fixative through the ovary.",

Each ovary was perfused independently of the other, which necessitated opening the abdomen with a U-shaped incision that extended from the pubis to the ribs. A ligature (4-0 surgical silk) was placed around both the ovarian artery and vein, and tied loosely in an overhand knot. A length of the uterine artery was carefully separated from its companion vein, and a second ligature was tied loosely around the artery. Ligatures were placed in similar locations around the vessels of the contralateral ovary. The uterine artery was grasped somewhat caudal to the ligature with fine forceps, lifted and pulled slightly taut. The cannula, with Krebs-Ringer-bicarbonate buffer (containing 2 mg/ml glucose, pH 7.4, 300 mOsm.) flowing from it a t a rate of 2.0 ml/min, was inserted into the uterine artery, guided past the ligature and secured into place by tightening the ligature. Then, in rapid sequence, a nick was made in the uterine vein to provide an outflow for the perfusate, and the ligature around the ovarian artery and vein was tightened, isolating the ovary from the circulatory system. After a 2-to 3-minute buffer wash, fixation was begun and continued for 10 to 30 minutes. Within a very short time after the fixative reached the ovary, the latter had begun to harden, indicating a favorable perfusion. After the perfusion was underway on one side, perfusion of the contralateral ovary was begun, following the same sequence. Attempts to perfuse the ovary through the abdominal aorta yielded results that were less consistent than those obtained by the method described here.",

At the electron microscopic level the most conspicuous organelle was the smooth ER, which filled most of the available cytoplasm (fig. 3 ). In perfused material of the present study, these membranes commonly were in the form of densely-packed, interwoven, 50-nm tubules, that repeatedly branched and anastomosed. Often the tubules of smooth ER were long, relatively straight and aligned parallel to each other; in favora-ble sections, they exhibited a hexagonal closepacking pattern (fig. 4 ). Smooth EtR also formed sheets (cisternae), perforated hy many evenly-spaced fenestrations (fig. 5 ). These cisternae were commonly organized in 2 to 25 concentric layers (whorls) around oither organelles, particularly lipid droplets. Cisternal and tubular smooth ER communicated freely with each other. Rough endoplasmic reticulum (rough ER) was moderately abundant, occurring as individual cisternae or as small patches of parallel cisternae (fig. 6 ).

Since these bodies are acid phosphatase (ACPase) -positive (Paavola, '75), they were considered to be primary lysosomes. Most of the dense bodies were residual bodies, which contained one or more myelin figures (fig. 13 ). Some of the residual bodies were also ACPase-positive (Paavola, '75). Autophagic vacuoles were rare a t this stage. Microperoxisome-like bodies, which were abundant, ranged in diameter from 0.05- 0.18 pm, were limited by a single membrane, contained a finely granular matrix and lacked a core or nucleoid (fig. 7 ). These inclusions often congregated near lipid droplets (fig. 7 ). Cytochemical incubation confirmed t h a t these bodies contained catalase (Paavola, '75). Several multivesicular bodies were present in each section of a luteal cell. These bodies contained small vesicles embedded in a matrix which varied considerably in density. Their limiting membranes sometimes displayed short, thickened patches (fig. 141 , which appeared to have arisen by fusion with coated vesicles. Possible stages in such a process were observed, confirming other similar observations in the literature.

These autophagic vacuoles, first observed in limited number in occasional luteal cells at 40 to 50 days of gestation, varied considerably in morphology, and thus could be divided roughly into four types, each of which will now be described. The most unusual and complex of the autophagic vacuoles seen in the present study, the intricate type (figs. 18, 19, 26, 27), has not been described previously in luteal cells. These distinctive, labyrinthine structures were composed of several electron-dense portions interconnected by double membranes. The double membranes were unusual in that the small space separating them contained a central dense line embedded in a moderately dense material (fig. 19 ). The spaces (compartments) delineated by the double membranes often contained ER, ribosomes and dense bodies (figs. 18, 19, 26). In many instances, the double membranes were observed in a less complex configuration; e.g., they occurred as independent, ring-or U-shaped entities that partially or completely surrounded various cytoplasmic organelles (figs. 18, 23 24 25 29 ). This double-membrane form of autophagic vacuole became more numerous after birth and will be discussed further in the section on 16 days postpartum. Near-term luteal cells contained yet another type of large, complex autophagic vacuole (fig. 30 ). This aggregate type autophagic vacuole was limited by a single membrane and usually contained many closelypacked, predominantly spherical bodies of varying size and electron-density, some of which appeared to be myelin figures (fig. 30 ). This inclusion resembled the \"multivesicular\" autophagic vacuole described briefly by Crombie et al. ('71) in an earlier report on guinea pig luteal cells. Lipid droplets and ribosomes commonly occurred within the aggregate autophagic vacuole. In addition to these more elaborate forms of autophagic vacuoles, nearterm luteal cells also contained a fourth type, similar in morphology to those described in many other cell types. This simple autophagic vacuole (fig. 28 ) appeared to be surrounded by a single membrane and most frequently contained ER. Although these simple autophagic vacuoles were seen a t all stages of pregnancy and postpartum, there was, a t most, one or two per section of cell, and there was no apparent increase in their number as involution progressed. The autophagic nature of the intricate, double-membrane and aggregate inclusions was confirmed by cytochemical incubation for ACPase activity (Paavola, '75). The simple autophagic vacuole generally lacked ACPase activity (Paavola, unpublished observations) .",

However, serial sections (fig. 45 ) showed that many of the double-membrane figures observed in regressing luteal cells were independent, roughly spherical structures, distinct from intricate autophagic vacuoles. In a similar vein, it might be claimed that the pockets of cytoplasm which appear to be sequestered within intricate autophagic vacuoles might. merely be tongues of cytoplasm protruding into deep recesses indenting the surface of these bodies. However, here again, serial sections demonstrated that the compartments were partitioned from the remaining cytoplasm by an uninterrupted membranous wall. Material from 16-day-postpartum animals was used for the studies of serial sections since doublemembrane and intricate autophagic vacuoles were particularly numerous a t this time. These findings should also apply to the corresponding bodies seen a t earlier stages, since their similarity in electron micrographs leaves no reason to doubt that they represent the same structures.",

After 30 to 35 days of gestation, the placenta supplies enough progesterone to support pregnancy, and although the corpus luteum continues to synthesize and secrete progesterone for some time, the ovaries are no longer required (Heap and Deanesly, '66) . From 35 days on, the contribution of the corpus luteum to total plasma progesterone declines steadily, and by 60 to 65 days of pregnancy, the level of plasma progesterone is the same in ovariectomized and intact animals, indicating that the amount of hormone released from the corpus luteum is negligible (Heap and Deanesly, '66) . However, even though the corpus luteum does not secrete progesterone, it contains appreciable amounts of the steroid (Heap et al., '67) . Shortly after birth of the young, plasma progesterone drops precipitously, a decline caused by loss of the placenta, and the plasma concentration remains low for about 48 hours, until the next corpus luteum, formed after parturition, begins secreting progesterone in measurable amounts (Challis et al., '71) .

For example, when progesterone secretion is maximal, a t 25 to 33 days of gestation, luteal cells of guinea pigs contain abundant tubules and cisternae of smooth ER, numerous mitochondria, a well-developed Golgi complex and occasional lipid droplets. Such ultrastructural features are characteristic of cells that are actively engaged in the synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones (Christensen and Gillim, '69) . Between 40 and 68 days of pregnancy, the amount of progesterone secreted by the corpus luteum gradually wanes. During this same period, a growing number of luteal cells display changes in their fine structure that seem to anticipate regression. Since the alterations in ultrastructure coincide tem-porally with the decreasing secretory activity of this tissue, it is tempting to suggest that the changing functional state is reflected in the fine structure. Near term, luteal cells of pregnant guinea pigs still contain relatively abundant smooth ER, when the progesterone content of the tissue is high but the ovarian contribution to plasma progesterone is slight. Throughout the postpartum period, an increasing number of luteal cells show regressive changes, such as bizarre mitochondria, pleomorphic dense bodies (lysosomes) and abundant autophagic vacuoles. The smooth ER is sparse in most postpartum luteal cells, and correspondingly the progesterone content of the tissue has reached its lowest value.",

Throughout this period, luteal cells degenerate asynchronously. Some luteal cells also involute sporadically during pregnancy but the number is low, accelerating markedly only after parturition. This protracted decline of the corpus luteum allows the degenerative changes occurring a t the cellular level to be considered in a temporal context. The results of this study indicate that as an individual luteal cell degenerates, whether prenatally or postnatally, it displays a characteristic sequence of fine-structural changes: First, autophagic vacuoles appear in the cytoplasm. Then, lysosomes accumulate, and alterations in nuclear and mitochondrial morphology occur. Later, unusual forms of lysosomes appear, mitochondria may enlarge or develop crystalline inclusions, and lipid droplets are sometimes extruded from the cell. In advanced regression, lipid droplets fuse with each other, autophagic vacuoles accumulate and the amount of smooth ER diminishes. Some luteal cells undergo a final step in luteolysis, an abrupt disintegration, with all organelles deteriorating simultaneously. Ultimately, the cell is ingested by a macrophage, a fate that can also befall luteal cells a t earlier stages in their involution (Paavola, '77) .",

                "text": "Clearly, the most striking change that takes place during this regression is the appearance and accumulation of distinctive cytoplasmic bodies that appear to be involved in autophagy, namely the intricate, double-membrane and aggregate inclusions. These structures first emerge, in limited numbers, in the last third of pregnancy, are more common near term and are particularly abundant postpartum. Cytochemical studies a t the electron microscope level reveal that these bodies contain pronounced ACPase activity (Paavola, '75) , supporting the view that they are lysosomal in nature. I t thus seems probable that these inclusions are the prime agents responsible for the degradation of cellular constituents during luteolysis. Further, they appear to be the earliest definite indication of regression a t the fine-structural level, corroborating a similar finding in sheep (Gemmell et al., '76 ). This contrasts with other studies in sheep in which the first signs of involution were reported to be nuclear fragmentation (Bjersing et al., '70a ) and mitochondrial changes (Deane et al., '66) . Moreover, in the present study the occurrence of autophagic vacuoles in large numbers throughout involution suggests that autophagy is a prominent mechanism in regression of the corpus luteum of the guinea pig after pregnancy. In an earlier report on guinea pigs (Crombie et al., '711 , autophagic vacuoles were mentioned only briefly. Autophagic vacuoles of varying description also have been reported to occur in regressing luteal cells of sheep (Bjersing et al., '70a, b; Gemmell et al., '76) and humans (van Lennep and Madden, '65; Quatacker, '71) . Although it is generally agreed that these bodies participate in involution, the extent of their involvement has not been fully resolved. Van Lennep and Madden ('65) suggest that they play only a minor role in the overall process of regression. On the other hand, the prominence of autophagic vacuoles during involution in the present study suggests that autophagy may have an important role in the destruction of corpora lutea.",

The only other cell type in which these unusual autophagic vacuoles have been described are macrophages. Pratt et al.

This speculation was given additional support by Belt et al. ('70, '71) , who observed in sows that somewhat similar bodies were absent during the estrous cycle, lacked ACPase activity and disappeared just prior to parturition, paralleling a rise in serum relaxin. Recently, on morphological grounds, Bagwell ('77) also speculated that similar bodies in gerbil luteal cells of late pregnancy might contain relaxin. However, in marked contrast to the findings of Belt et al. ('70, '71) , the double-membrane and intricate inclusions of the present study are strongly ACPase-positive (Paavola, '751, do not disappear prior to parturition and accumulate in regressing luteal cells during the postpartum period, all of which argue against these bodies being a prime site of relaxin storage. It thus seems more reasonable to suggest, as has been done in this report, that the double-membrane and intricate inclusions observed in luteal cells of guinea pigs participate primarily in intracellular digestive events, presumably autophagy.

                "text": "The development of these autophagic vacuoles is of considerable interest since their origin has not been firmly established in any species. The membranes circumscribing au-PAAVOLA tophagic vacuoles in other tissues have been described as arising from the Golgi complex (Frank and Christensen, '68; Locke and Sykes, '75) , smooth ER (Novikoff and Shin, '64; Arstila and Trump, '681, GERL (Novikoff, '64) and plasma membrane (van Lennep and Madden, '65; Quatacker, '71) . Images seen in the present study suggest that the membranes of intricate autophagic vacuoles are derived from GERL cisternae, via double-membrane autophagic vacuoles. The proposed developmental sequence follows: GERL cisternae develop a dense content (fig. 21 ). become cupshaped (fig. 22 ), gain a central dense line and leave the Golgi-GERL area (fig. 23 ). These newly-formed, cup-shaped bodies then attach to pre-existing dense bodies (figs. 24, 251, forming double-membrane inclusions. Continued fusion of these double-membrane autophagic vacuoles with each other and with other dense bodies ultimately gives rise to the intricate forms of autophagic vacuoles (figs. 26,27) that are prominent in regressing luteal cells. The cytochemical demonstration of ACPase activity in GERL, and in the doublemembrane and intricate forms of autophagic vacuoles (Paavola, '75) lends additional support to this proposed developmental sequence. The stimulus responsible for the formation of these ACPase-containing autophagic vacuoles is unknown, but several lines of evidence from various species suggest that it may possibly be the luteolysin, prostaglandin Fza (Bagwell et al., '75; Henderson and McNatty, '75; Kaley and Weiner, '75; Koering and Kirton, '73; Stacy et al., '76; Weiner and Kaley, '75) .",

In earlier reports in the literature, the behavior of the smooth ER was commonly regarded as a prominent feature of involution. This organelle was usually described as becoming vesicular (Priedkalns and Weber, '68; Bjersing et al., '70a1, vacuolar (van Lennep and Madden, '65; Cavazos et al., '69) or structureless (Crombie et al., '71) . In perfusion-fixed material of the present study, the smooth ER did not show any dramatic changes prior to alterations in other cellular organelles, suggesting that it does not lose its integrity until after being sequestered into autophagic vacuoles or until there is widespread degeneration throughout the cytoplasm. This finding in guinea pigs agrees with that of Deane et al. ('66) on degenerating luteal cells of sheep. It is in contrast to a previous description of luteolysis in the guinea pig (Crombie et al., '71) . The deterioration of the smooth ER in these various early studies may either have been a consequence of fixation by immersion or reflect species differences.",

Such cells may well arise because of the sequence in which cellular organelles are degraded. During regression, autophagic vacuoles often contain lipid droplets, lysosomes, ER, ribosomes, and ground substance, but mitochondria are conspicuously absent from such structures. Furthermore, mitochondrialaden cells, which are smaller than younger luteal cells, were observed near the end of involution, and generally had a paucity of smooth ER and lipid droplets. The ability of mitochondria to escape autophagy may account for the abundance of this organelle in older luteal cells.",

                "text": "The remaining ultrastructural changes observed in regressing luteal cells of this study are basically similar to those described in various species. For example, the dramatic increase in lipid droplets is one of the most commonly encountered involutive phenomena, and has been described previously in guinea pig (Crombie et al., '711, human (Adams and Hertig, '69) , sheep (Deane et al., '66; Bjersing et al., '70a; Gemmell et al., '761, sow (Cavazos et al., '691, cow (Priedkalns and Weber, '681, hamster (Leavitt et al., '73) and rabbit (Blanchette, '66) . This accumulation of lipid droplets in senescent luteal cells may indicate a decreased utilization of cholesterol esters, since it is known that both cholesterol esterase and cholesterol ester synthetase are decreased under these conditions (Behrman et al., '71) . Some, but not all, of the alterations in mitochondria1 morphology observed here have been described previously, sometimes only briefly, in degenerating luteal cells of guinea pig (Crombie et al., '71; Bourneva, '73) , sheep (Deane et al., '66; Bjersing et al., '70a), mink (Mnller, '73) and hamster (Leavitt et al., '73) . The significance of these changes in the structure of mitochondria is unclear, although these alterations seem to occur in parallel with the changing function of this organelle as it shifts away from its role in steroidogenesis. Mitochondria that are deficient in cytochrome oxidase (Karnovsky, '63) or have been injured (David and Kettler, '61) exhibit somewhat similar morphological alterations. In the present study, lysosome-like bodies increased markedly in quantity as regression progressed. Comparable increases in the number of lysosomes (dense bodies) preceding or during involution have been reported in studies on rabbit (Blanchette, '66) , sow (Cavazos et al., '69) , cow (Priedkalns and Weber, '68) and hamster (Leavitt et al., '73) . However, in one paper on sheep, Gemmell et al. ('76) maintained that lysosomes did not increase during luteolysis.",

The destruction of luteal cells involves the orderly sequestration of cellular organelles within autophagic vacuoles, where they are broken down, followed ultimately by the removal of the cell or its remnants by macrophages. Moreover, this regression is characterized by the emergence of \"new\" structures (autoph-agic vacuoles and pleomorphic lysosomes) , rather than by marked degenerative changes in the pre-existing organelles. The results of this study further indicate that some of the autophagic vacuoles arise from GERL. Frequently, the smooth ER (ser) tubules are long, relatively straight and aligned parallel to each other (between arrows). When cut in cross-section, it is apparent that these tubules are arranged in a closely-packed, hexagonal array (inside box). This micrograph shows an unusual abundance of these highly ordered tubules. X 23,000.",

Pleomorphic mitochondria abound, and many display crystals within their cristae. An intricate autophagic vacuole (ia) is located a t the center of the field.

The third inclusion (double arrows), also enclosed by a single membrane, is filled with heterogeneous dense material. From various views that have beem observed, these three bodies may possibly represent developmental stages from autophagic vacuole to advanced residual body. For example, breakdown of the inner of the two membranes surrounding the large double-membrane autophagic vacuole and partial digestion of the contents might give rise to a structure resembling the second inclusion (large arrow). Continued digestion of the contents might eventually lead to the formation of a residual body, much like the third inclusion illustrated here. X 20.000.",

Occasional macrophages (m) appear in the field. At five days postpartum, a striking increase in the number of lipid droplets is evident in most luteal cells. The abundant lipid droplets often differ in density and size. Occasionally, much enlarged lipid droplets (long arrows) are noted, which can be compared with normal-sized lipid dropletn (short arrow) in the same cell (the pale ring around the smaller droplet is a whorl of smooth ER). Several luteal cells in this field show a marked increase in the number of large dense bodies (arrowheads). Luteal cell nuclei (n) usually display irregular contours at this stage.
