Mills are located close to the cane growers to minimize cane degradation and transportation costs. The raw sugar is subsequently transported to a refinery where the remaining impurities are removed. Figure 1 shows the basic steps in the production of raw sugar from sugarcane. Sucrose is first extracted from sugar cane with water, by counter current milling or cane diffusion. The juice is screened, heated to its boiling point, and then flashed. Suspended solids and colloidal materials are then precipitated with milk of lime \u017d . calcium hydroxide solution and settled in a clarifier. The resulting clear juice is evaporated to approximately 65% dissolved solids in a multiple-effect evaporator train. Sugar is then crystallized from the syrup in a three-stage crystallization process. After each crystallization step, sugar crystals are separated from the mother liquor in centrifuges. The raw sugar is then transported to the refinery, where it is dissolved, purified, and recrystallized to white sugar.",

Going back to the linear isotherm, if K decreases, then q is forced to decrease, releasing material already absorbed on the resin. This effect appears to explain the phenomena occurring in Figure 5 . In addition, it is interesting to note that the effect appears to occur in parallel to the change in the pH and conductivity of the product. Changing the pH of a colorant solution drastically affects its color, indicating a pH sensitivity of the colorant molecule. It appears, in this case, that either or both the resin and the colorant display a change in affinity for each other as the pH increases. Most sugar colorants are amphiphilics, and so at low pH they take on a positive charge, allowing them to be adsorbed into the resin matrix. As the pH of the surrounding solution increases, some of the colorants switch back to their anionic form and are released from the resin. Essentially the equilibrium constant becomes a function of pH. It will be assumed that this dependence will be similar to the Arrhenius equation. Since the pH is defined as a logarithmic func-\u017d . tion, this equation will be adapted slightly so that K pH is high at low pH conditions and decreases exponentially to a constant value at high pH conditions K pH s K e y pH q K 14 \u017d . \u017d .",

As the pH increases, the adsorption parameter greatly decreases, causing some components to elute from the column and others to be retained less strongly by the resin. The decrease was modeled using an adapted Arrhenius equation. If the resin is to be operated making use of its full decolorizing power, the pH must not be allowed to increase in the column. The conductivity of the product appeared to be a good indicator of the state of the resin. A falling conductivity gave some advanced warning of an impending color problem. Operating in the low conductivity, ''softening,'' region allows \u017d . the removal of divalent cations such as calcium, magnesium , thus increasing the demineralization capacity of the resin. This becomes less attractive when the decolorizing ability of the resin is considered.",

A more thorough investigation into the use of methanol or ethanol washes is recommended.",
