Although there may be a certain degree of bias in this quality of care assessment tool since some of these measurements may be misleading, it remains an inexpensive tool for such assessments. The quality of services provided to diabetic patients in Palestine has not been studied previously. This study provides a context for the measurement of the quality of care of patients with diabetes.\nObjectives: To evaluate the agreement on testing at the proper time between self-report and medical record in primary care centers in the West Bank.\nMethods: Data from interviews and medical records were available on 882 diabetic patients attending nine primary health care centers in Palestine. Cohen's kappa coefficient (k), agreement beyond chance, between data provided in patient medical record and self-report was calculated.\nAgreement on testing at the proper time between self-report and medical record was poor to fair in strength (k: 0.06-0.28), and was poor to substantial (k: 0.10-0.70) for diabetes comorbids. After adjustment, clinic location and ownership were strong determinants for agreement in the proper time of testing. Also, the personal characteristic age and gender were the most important factors in determining comorbids in those patients.\nThe evaluation of the quality of care based on medical records should be treated with great caution in Palestine since it's a manual process. However, reliance on both sources of information is useful to establish monitoring tools on which decisions can be based.",

Studies that investigate diabetes, hypertension [2, [4] [5] [6] , hyper-lipidemia [2, 6] , and cardiovascular diseases [4, [7] [8] [9] found variable agreement between these two sources of information. These studies found that agreement was most likely to be affected by the personal characteristics of patients such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, obesity, clinical characteristics of patients, patients awareness and literacy, understanding of their health condition, a family history of disease and their ability to recall [2, 3, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, similar validation studies in countries of political instability with a protracted conflict and which are suffering from fragile infrastructure of social and public health services are not published yet.",

However, agreement was moderate (k=0.37) in the Minnesota-USA study [20] , in which findings demonstrated more over-reporting than underreporting of eye examinations by patients. This study found similar findings when comparing self-reports of an eye examination during the previous year with reported referral for eye examination (k=0.20). Also, moderate agreement was found when comparing self-reports of eye problems with a diagnosis of retinopathy in patient's medical records (k=0.34). Referral for an eye examination was more under-reported (37%), but was over-reported (30.5%) in relation to eye problems when compared with records of retinopathy diagnosis. This might indicate that patients were referred, but did not undergo the eye examination since it is not covered by their health insurance; or patients may be examined by an ophthalmologist, but their examination results are not in their records. Another possible explanation is the physician factor, where a physician obtains an eye examination report without telling the patient their results. Older age groups reported more eye examinations and those followed up in NGOs clinics had much fewer eye examinations than those registered in UNRWA and MoH clinics, which suggests better health services. Agreement was shown to be strongest in the north compared to other regions.",

This could be justified by good recall and understanding of the nature and effect of these illnesses. Patient age was a significant factor in determining the comparison between self-reports records data of these comorbids. Also, such comorbids are very significant for those patients and are followed up thoroughly by physicians due to their ongoing effects on patient health. This may also be true for the moderate agreement morbidities: kidney problems and foot ulcers. Kidney function testing was over-reported by 14% of patients and was of low kappa (0.28) and microalbuminurea was over-reported by 61% of them (k=0.06). Also, 19% of patients reported having an ECG test, but the results were not present in their records; this also applied to lipid profiling. Therefore, these findings indicate that those patients might lack information about these tests, or the results of these tests are not recorded in their records. These results are consistent with the Swiss study that showed low Cohen's kappa (k \u2264 0.50) for foot examination, but high for blood pressure (k=0.94). Collet and colleagues justified this by the possible physician factors that affect the presence of reports in patients' medical records and lead to bias such as under-reporting [21] . This may be a serious problem in poorly developed health systems, such as in Palestine where no electronic recording exists. In addition, we emphasize that physicians in PHC centers see a high number of patients daily, both in the UNRWA and MoH clinics. Such problems are of low priority in health systems where electronic records are in operation.",

Therefore, we asked interviewees about this possibility prior to interviewing them and verified if we had interviewed them previously.
