The earliest \u017d . work is that of Worthington 1877 who reported an investigation of drops of liquids falling vertically on a horizontal plate. Since then, there have been a number of investigations on the subject. While some of the investigations have been \u017d entirely experimental Bergeron et al., 2000; Sikalo et al., . 2002 , most of the studies have included theoretical andror numerical modeling approaches for predicting the spreading \u017d phenomenon. The theoretical approach Engel, 1955; Ford and Furmidge, 1967; Chandra and Avedisian, 1991; Asai et . al., 1993; Fukai et al., 1998 involves the use of an energy balance on the system, which consists of the drop and the impacted surface, to develop an equation for predicting the U \u017d maximum spreading ratio D ratio of the maximum spreadm Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to W.

The Kodak camera system had several advantages over the Sensicam camera system. One was obtaining data was much faster since repeated tests required by the Sensicam camera system were not necessary. This also meant fewer surfaces had to be prepared. Another was that the Sensicam camera system could not be used for the impingement test at low Re because the distance between the needle and the solid surface was too small to accommodate the laser triggering system. The Sensicam camera system was used for the spontaneous spreading tests because the fluid layer resulting from spontaneous spreading was very thin. The higher resolution associated with the Sensicam camera system facilitated measurement of the spreading ratio. , 1955; Ford and Furmidge, 1967; Chandra and Avedisian, 1991; Asai et al., 1993; Pasandideh-Fard et al., 1996; Mao et . al., 1997; Fukai et al., 1998 are based on an energy conserva-\u017d . tion equation, where system energy at impact state 1 is set \u017d . equal to system energy at maximum spreading state 2 . The assumptions are made that the drop volume is conserved and the drop spreads into a cylindrical disk of diameter D and height h. The cylindrical-disk assumption is reasonable except for low impact velocities, particularly for high contact angles where the surface area of the cylindrical disk is much higher than the actual surface area. In our model, we make the relatively simple change of assuming that the shape of the fluid in state 2 is a cap of a sphere rather than a cylindrical disk, again holding the fluid volume constant. This geometry which more closely represents the physics of low velocity impact leads to better predictions at low impact velocities, while giving predictions very similar to those of Mao et The energy conservation equation used for previous models is",

The maximum spreading ratio increases with increas-\u017d ing impact velocity for all of the surfaces as expected Ford and Furmidge, 1967; Cheng, 1977; Scheller and Bousfield, \u02c7. 1995; Sikalo et al., 2002 . Figure 4a is for water on a hy-\u017d . drophilic surface slide glass , and Figure 4b is for water on a \u017d . hydrophobic surface Teflon film . As discussed above, the impacting process for the hydrophilic surface has only two stages: spreading to the maximum spreading ratio and retracting to the equilibrium spreading ratio. The impacting process for the hydrophobic surface includes spreading, retracting and sometimes rebounding if impact velocity is high enough, and then spreading to the equilibrium spreading ratio. The final equilibrium spreading ratio is primarily determined by the solid-liquid interaction and varies slightly with impacting velocity. \u017d .

The main new feature of the model lies in the simple geometrical assumption of a spherical cap, rather than a cylindrical disk as in most prior work, for the spreading drop. This geometrical assumption, designed to provide better small-Re and small-We predictions, leads to predictions which when compared to existing models in the literature are not \u017d . only better for low drop impact velocities small Re and We , but in most cases are within 10% of the experimental data even at high impact velocities.",
