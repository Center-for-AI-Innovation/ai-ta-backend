The strategy involves maintaining the temperature at some location in the multivessel column section by manipulating the reflux flow rate out of the corresponding vessel above. Their simulation results indicate that the temperature controller achieved the same steady-state product compositions in the vessels that is independent of the initial feed composition, thus able to \u017d . tackle feed composition disturbances. Noda et al. 2000 later presented a more complex on-line feedback-control strategy to optimally operate the multivessel system. The on-line system consists of four subsystems, namely a composition measuring subsystem using a near-infrared analyzer, a composition estimation and model update subsystem, an optimization subsystem, and, finally, a control subsystem.",

Despite the fact that the column section length and configuration of the multivessel system itself has a major impact on the separation performance, no design study has been reported in the open literature, either in terms of the effect on the separation process or in terms of optimization, which takes into account this key design decision variable. The optimal design of the multivessel system should be considered, since the main drawback of the multivessel system is the high initial capital outlay associated with the larger number of column sections needed in the system. The total combined column section length can be several times that of a regular column. Thus, it is important to optimally design the multivessel system to include a trade-off in capital cost.",

The total reflux holdup policy is also desirable for its high product yield due to no offcut. From a design study point of view, the focus on the simplest operating policy allows for the benefit of the system design to be highlighted more clearly.

In their article, in addition to the normal product purity specification, the mean production rate constraints for each product had to be specified. The operation then tends to steer toward the lower bound of the mean production rates specification, that is, a system operating at minimum troughputs that only just meets the market demand, so as to have the lowest energy consumption. Thus, it only applies for a scenario whereby the size of the market demand is fixed. This is not the case in most real industrial scenarios whereby, in addition to minimizing the energy consumption, there is a perpetual incentive to increase production yield and to minimize batch time, that is, to increase the number of batches.

Table 8 \u017d . lists the different purity constraint scenarios cases A to F for the separation of a 1,000-mol quaternary and equimolar mixture of methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, and n-butanol. The multivessel system consists of three column sections attached to the reboiler, two side vessels, and a reflux drum where the four products are collected, respectively. The model specifications, products pricing, decision variable bounds, and cost correlation parameters are similar to those of the preceding case study. To simplify the comparison, all products are assumed to be of equal value for all purities specification. The optimal multivessel system design results for cases A to F are presented in Table 9 and Figure 6 . The figure clearly illustrates that the optimal multivessel configuration is highly influenced by different separation duties. The general trend confirms the intuition that the higher the purity specification, \u017d . the lower the profitability achieved Table 9 . This is due mainly to the longer batch-processing time needed to achieve the higher specifications. For example, the profit obtained for case A with low product purities is 321,542 $ryr, while the profit case D with higher purity requirements is considerably lower at 187,806 $ryr.
