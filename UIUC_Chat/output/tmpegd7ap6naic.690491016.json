The efficiency with respect to the adsorbate and adsorbent was determined to estimate the performance of the process of adsorption. The effect of flow rate, \u2423 -amylase inlet concentration, temperature, and particle size of the packing was analyzed. In addition, the transient response, in the form of experimental breakthrough cur\u00aees, was fitted using a phenomenological mathematical model accounting for the external-film and pore-diffusion mass-transfer mechanisms as well as axial dispersion along the column. Also, a Langmuir isotherm was included in the model to account for the extent of the equilibrium of adsorption. The model described satisfactorily the experimental breakthrough cur\u00aees and it pro\u00aeed to predict successfully the beha\u00aeior of a scaled-up bed using the kinetic and equilibrium parameters estimated pre\u00aeiously. Thus, the mathematical model can be considered a reliable tool for process design and scale-up of similar systems.",

The operating procedure just given is obviously performed to avoid losses of adsorbate in the effluent. At industrial scale, the time when the operation stops must be determined after an economic and, eventually, environmental evaluation, because not only the amount of solute adsorbed but the operating time has an important impact on the effective use of the column and on the final throughput of the process, too. The optimization of this and other operating conditions can be accomplished with the help of reliable mathematical models.",

Since the effect of flow rate was studied using an average particle size of 0.41 mm, and only a slight or even negligible external mass-transfer resistance was observed, the increase in the effectiveness for smaller particles must be mainly due to a decrease in the internal diffusion control. Under these conditions, the overall kinetics of the process was faster because the time for a molecule of adsorbate to reach the adsorption site was shorter, since the diffusional path along the pores was shorter, too. The negative effect of the particle size on the masstransfer flux from the interstitial \u2423-amylase solution to the external surface of the adsorbent particles was qualitatively analogous, and was related to the positive effect of the flow rate, as mentioned in the preceding section.

Figure 10 shows the concentration profile of \u2423-amylase along the longitudinal axis of the column at different operating times.

This cutoff value was chosen arbitrarily in order to compare the results between different experiments carried out at different operating conditions. In these conditions, the calculations yielded very high levels of e in all the experiments, with all the values in the S range 0.95\u13900.97. These high values of e were due to the S steep curve following the breakthrough of the bed that resulted in low values of the area A .2",
