This flow geometry is quite simple, yet manifests mixed flow kinematics. In particu- Otter 1970 , and White and Baird 1986 , to name a few, have found that not all polymer melts exhibit vortex formation. Specifically, Ballenger and White found that highly \u017d . long-chain branched low-density polyethylene LDPE exhibited substantial vortex growth, while linear high-density \u017d . polyethylene HDPE did not. Similar results were observed by den Otter for branched and linear polydimethylsiloxane \u017d . \u017d . PDMS resins. White and Baird 1986 investigated the \u017d . streamlines of LDPE and polystyrene PS and found that flow tapering was related to the degree of extensional strain hardening and the intensity of the vortices was determined by the shear thinning behavior. Highly branched LDPE, exhibiting considerable extensional strain hardening and shear thinning behavior, showed significant tapering and intense vortices.

The simplest rheological constitutive equation used to describe polymer melts is the \u017d . inelastic generalized Newtonian fluid GNF model. Although capable of describing the shear-thinning nature of polymer melts, the GNF model does not capture viscoelastic phenomena such as fluid memory, normal stress differences, and extensional strain-hardening behavior. On the other hand, viscoelastic constitutive equations such as the Phan \u017d . ThienrTanner PTT and factorized K-BKZ models are known to accurately describe nonlinear rheological phenom-\u017d ena Phan Thien and Tanner, 1977; Kaye, 1962; Bernstein et . al., 1963 . Both the PTT and K-BKZ models can accurately describe shear thinning, normal stress differences, and extensional strain-hardening behavior in uniaxial extension. This is especially important when predicting free surface flows, such as extrudate swell. The major weakness of using the K-BKZ model is that it cannot accurately predict simultaneously both shear thinning and planar extensional strain hardening using \u017d traditional damping functions Samurkas et al., 1989; Ahmed . and Mackley, 1995 . As a result, its use in planar contraction geometries is limited. More recently, McLeish and Larson \u017d . 1998 have developed the pom-pom constitutive model that specifically addresses the effects of long-chain branching on extensional viscosity. The pom-pom model is capable of predicting extensional strain hardening in both uniaxial and planar extension. Unfortunately, the large number of model parameters and the arbitrary nature by which they are chosen can limit its implementation in numerical simulations at present.",

The most common method for determining \u232c P is ent \u017d . by applying the Bagley end correction Bagley, 1957 . This method involves extrapolating the measured pressure drop across multiple capillaries of the same diameter and differing length to a LrD of zero. This extrapolated quantity then represents \u232c P for the given contraction ratio. The effects of ent pressure, viscous heating, and wall slip can also contribute to substantial error in the value of \u232c P . Although the use of a ent \u017d . very short die LrD; 0 mitigates these effects, the relatively small measurable pressure drop can also lead to significant uncertainty. In order to avoid uncertainties associated with explicitly calculating \u232c P , measurement of the hydrodyent namic pressure along the contraction geometry should provide more accurate results. This approach addresses the effects of \u232c P on the upstream pressure measurements while ent reducing the uncertainty associated with extrapolating experimental measurements. This technique also simplifies the application of numerical predictions by eliminating the need to extrapolate predicted pressure profiles to the contraction entrance.",

Two well-characterized polyethylene resins having different shear and extensional flow characteristics will be investigated in this study. A multimode PTT model and an inelastic GNF model will be used to model the rheological characteristics of each polyethylene and predict the pressure profiles along the chosen 4:1 planar contraction geometry. Comparing the PTT and GNF predictions will isolate the specific role of fluid memory and extensional strain hardening on the pressure-profile predictions. Predicted streamline patterns and the planar extensional strain rates and stresses along the plane of symmetry will be used to further compare the influence of viscoelasticity and extensional strain hardening.",

First, it can be seen that the model predictions are much more accurate for the LLDPE resin than they are for the LDPE resin. Both the PTT and GNF model predictions are within 5.0% of the experimentally measured pressures. Second, the GNF model appears to do a better job of predicting the pressure profile than the PTT model. The GNF predictions are in very good agreement with the measured profile, having an average error of only 1.4%. This overall better agreement is most likely due to the lack of significant nonlinear behavior for LLDPE. The delayed onset of shear thinning, short relaxation times, and the lack of extensional strain hardening are much more Newtonian like than the behavior exhibited by the LDPE melt. As a result, the GNF model does as good a job of describing the pressure drop through the contraction die as the PTT model. The value of We is \u017d . also much smaller at 0.67 15.6 , but is noticeably higher w at 0.08 MPa.

Table 4 summarizes the range of flow rates investigated and the average error between experimental and numerical profiles for each fluid description. Surprisingly, the PTT predictions for LLDPE did not suffer from this limitation. PTT predictions for the LLDPE resin were obtained up to the maximum apparent shear-rate investigated of 37.0 s y1 . The experimental measurements of the pressure profile and the obtainable numerical predictions at the highest apparent shear rate are presented in Figures 8 and 9 . Figure 8 compares the experimental values for LDPE at \u2425 s 37.0 s y1 to the GNF model predictions. Once again, \u02d9a considerable underprediction is observed, with an average error of 12%. This is most likely due to poorly captured extensional characteristics that are important in the entrance region. On the other hand, Figure 9 exhibits the opposite trend for LLDPE. Now the model predictions consistently overpredict the measured pressure profiles. This reversal may at first seem inconsistent, but the calculated wall shear stress is in excess of 0.21 MPa, and surface melt fracture was observed experimentally. In this case, the presence of a finite slip velocity at the die wall associated with melt fracture may justify this decrease in the observed profile values, but experimental slip velocity measurements were not performed to confirm this. The results obtained from the measured and calculated pressure profiles clearly indicate that model predictions for the LLDPE resin are generally more accurate than those for the LDPE resin. The consistent underprediction of the hydrodynamic pressure along the contraction die for LDPE implies that the calculated magnitude of \u232c P is less than obent served. This agrees in general with the observations of \u017d . \u017d . Barakos and Mitsoulis 1995 and Mitsoulis 2001 . Conversely, the results obtained for LLDPE would appear to be adequate, at least to within the accuracy of the experimental pressure measurements of \"2%.

This trend was observed for both LDPE and LLDPE.

Figure 10 shows the predicted streamlines obtained from PTT and GNF simulations for both LDPE and LLDPE at \u2425 s8.55 \u02d9a s y1 . This apparent shear rate was chosen because it represents the maximum rate for which convergent PTT predictions are available for both LDPE and LLDPE. Figure 10a presents the predictions for LDPE. Clearly, the PTT model predicts sizeable recirculating vortices in the reentrant corners and pronounced tapering of the flow into the contraction. This tapering becomes more apparent when the GNF predictions, which do not exhibit vortices, are also plotted. The streamline along the plane of symmetry as predicted by the PTT model represents \u233f s1.0, and the minimum value versely, LLDPE does not show a large degree of tapering into the contraction. Figure 10b shows that the predictions for the PTT and GNF model for LLDPE are very similar, with only slight deviations near the contraction. Although a small vortex is predicted in the PTT simulated streamlines, the minimum value of the streamline function is \u233f s min y0.0016, which is more than three times smaller than that calculated for LDPE. This reduced intensity of the vortex has been observed for polymer melts exhibiting less shear-thin-\u017d . ning behavior White and Baird, 1986 . The predicted degree of flow tapering, as well as the intensity of the recirculating vortices, is dependent upon the constitutive model and the model parameters used. The streamline predictions of the PTT model for LDPE show significant vortex growth and flow tapering into the contraction. On the other hand, less tapering and diminished vortices are predicted for the LLDPE melt. Together, these results agree qualitatively with prior experimental observations and numerical simulations of linear and branched polyethylene melts \u017dWhite and Kondo, 1977; Dupont and Crochet, 1988; Ahmed . et al., 1995; Mitsoulis, 2001 . However, one begins to realize that capturing the correct flow kinematics does not necessarily imply an accurate prediction of the hydrodynamic pressures. This observation confirms prior studies by Barakos and \u017d . Mitsoulis 1995 . A better assessment of the effects of viscoelasticity and extensional strain hardening may lie in the extrastress predictions.",

Well upstream and downstream of the contraction the planar extension rate approaches zero, while the extension rate becomes significant at the contraction. In this section, the pre- dicted extension rates and the calculated net planar stresses \u017d . s \u1390 will be analyzed. Figure 11 presents the predicted extensional characteristics of LDPE in the vicinity of the abrupt contraction. The planar extension rate and the unsteady planar stress q are plotted 1 as a function of the position for both the PTT and GNF model predictions. The planar extension rates are first observed to increase at a location approximately 0.45 cm upstream. As a fluid element approaches the contraction, it then begins to stretch more rapidly before passing through a maximum extension rate of \u2440 s1.36 s y1 for the PTT predictions and \u2440 s \u02d91.31 s y1 for the GNF predictions. Further comparisons between the two models show that the increase in the extension rate is more acute for the GNF model than the PTT model. This observation is best explained by the tapered streamlines first shown in Figure 10a . The flow tapering leads to a gradual increase in the extension rate as the fluid element passes through the contraction rather than a sharp increase. Although the planar stresses show similar trends, the magnitudes of the net stress are substantially different. The PTT model-predicted planar stress for the LDPE resin is 130% greater than that of the GNF predictions at their peak extension rates near y sy0.5 cm. This difference is due to the strain-hardening behavior predicted by the PTT constitutive model.",

This is markedly different from the predictions observed for LDPE. These similarities in the extension rates concur with the streamline patterns previously seen in Figure 10b . Although there is considerably less disparity in the predicted planar stresses for LLPDE compared to those of LDPE, they do exhibit some differences at the peak extension rate near y sy0.025 cm. The PTT predictions are approximately 25% greater than the GNF predictions. This can be attributed to the slight differences in the extensional characteristics of the two constitutive models.

In light of the fact that the predicted pressure profiles for LDPE were consistently lower than the measured quantities, one concern was that the PTT model parameters were not accurately predicting the extensional properties of LDPE. More specifically, in this study it was chosen to use a single value of \u2440 common to all modes and then to fit that parameter using uniaxial extensional data obtained at 1.0 s y1 . Although this approach may lead to poor predictions at lower extension rates, it was determined that fitting to the highest available extension rate was most relevant to predicting the pressure profiles at the higher flow rates used here. In order to confirm this idea, model fitting of the \u2440 parameter was performed using extensional data obtained at \u2440 s 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 s y1 . The corre-\u1e61ponding values of \u2440 were determined to be 10 y6 , 0.021, and 0.034, respectively. From those parameters, the transient planar extensional viscosities were calculated as a function of strain at a planar extension rate of 1.0 s y1 . The calculated results are presented in Figure 14 . One notices that the observed extensional viscosities increase with decreasing values of \u2440. Again, it should be noted that \u2440 s 0.034 refers to data obtained at 1.0 s y1 . Therefore, at high strains variations in the extensional viscosities are observed, and these variations could give rise to different pressure-profile predictions. However, a fluid element passing through a 4:1 contraction will experience a maximum, accumulated strain of only 1.39 strain units along the plane of symmetry. This can be calculated by the simple relation, \u2440 s ln \u2424, where \u2424 is the planar con-H traction ratio. From Figure 14 , the differences in the planar extensional viscosities associated with \u2440 s1.39 are found to H be less than 9%. This relative insensitivity to \u2440 was also observed for the calculated extensional viscosities at s 0.01 and 0.1 s y1 and the corresponding pressure profiles and \u017d streamline patterns predicted from simulations not shown for . \u017d . brevity Doerpinghaus, 2002 . Therefore, the influence of parameter fitting and the accuracy of the extensional viscosity predictions at high strains, or even steady state, are not as important as at small strains. Of course, this fortuitous result may not apply at larger contraction ratios in which the total strain is larger.",

In fact, the GNF \u02d9a predictions were arguably more accurate than the PTT model predictions. At higher rates, the possible effects of melt fracture and wall slip led to an overprediction of the upstream pressure values by both constitutive models.

Pronounced tapering of the flow into the abrupt contraction with the presence of sizable recirculating corner vortices are predicted for the LDPE material. Conversely, streamlines for the LLDPE material are very similar to the GNF predictions and the size and magnitude of the corner vortex is substantially smaller. The extensional deformation along the plane of symmetry suggests that the fluid relaxation behavior negates the effects of extensional strain-hardening behavior in the contraction region. LDPE, exhibiting a long characteristic relaxation time and high degree of extensional strain hardening, attains only 10% of the steady-state planar extensional stress as it passes through the contraction region. LLDPE, which exhibits a shorter relaxation time and extensional strainsoftening behavior, attains 60% of its steady-state stress. Thus, the relaxation behavior of the polymer melt limits the magnitude of the planar extensional stress developed through a 4:1 contraction.",

This is confirmed by the relative insensitivity of the predicted values to variations in nonlinear extensional parameter \u2440 for the PTT model. This fortuitous response may also explain the similarities exhibited by the PTT and GNF model predictions despite variations in the predicted flow kinematics. Additional studies investigating larger contraction ratios or other flow geometries that give rise to large extensional strains should be performed to assess the significance of extensional strain hardening on pressure-profile predictions. In the case of the 4:1 planar contraction studied here, the underpredicted pressure profiles for LDPE are not completely understood, but could be elucidated further using full-field flow birefringence and velocimetry measurements of the contraction region.",
