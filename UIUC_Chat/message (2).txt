The case example is an immunocompromised patient who had a catheter infection with Bacillus cereus. The diagnostic algorithm of ruling Bacillus anthracis in/out is emphasized. B anthracis as a potential bioterrorism agent requires additional safety precautions during workup. Identification of Bacillus requires visualization of spores. B cereus is an environmental bacterium and often represents contamination of the specimen. It can be associated with serious infections such as bacteremia, endocarditis, ocular infections, musculoskeletal infections, and a variety of opportunistic infections in patients who are immunocompromised. Contamination of food leads to short-or long-incubation gastroenteritis due to production of different toxins; the gastroenteritis is usually benign and self-limiting.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'eq_spans': [], 'section': '', 'sec_num': None}, {'text': 'Cryptococcus neoformans var gattii: Changing Epidemiology in an Emerging North American Pathogen Microbiology No. MB 08-4 (MB-353) Avis R. Picton, MD, CCFP, 1 and Linda Hoang, MSc, MD, FRCFP. 1,2 1 The University of British Columbia, and 2 BC Centre for Disease Control, Vancouver, Canada. Cryptococcus neoformans var gattii emerged in 1999 as a pathogen on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Unlike C neoformans var neoformans and Cryptococcus var grubii, it tends to infect hosts with normal immunity, causing pneumonia or meningoencephalitis. This organism should be ruled out in HIVnegative travelers returning from southwestern British Columbia who develop pulmonary or neurologic symptoms. Routine imaging may miss central nervous system disease; lumbar puncture is crucial to diagnosis, and cerebrospinal fluid cryptococcal-antigen testing is highly sensitive. In pulmonary disease, X-ray findings of nodules, infiltrates, or even obstructing endobronchial lesions may be seen. The fungus is easily cultured in the laboratory, but distinguishing the varieties requires specialized canavanine-glycinebromthymol blue (CGB) agar and/or genotyping. For treatment, consultation with an infectious disease specialist is recommended. Further information may be obtained from the BC Centre for Disease Control (www.bccdc.org). Infection due to Streptobacillus moniliformis is relatively rare, with fewer than 300 cases reported in North America. We present a case of a previously healthy 14-year-old male who had a 1-day history of fever, petechial rash (involving the face, torso, and palms and soles of the feet), vomiting, diarrhea, and progressive drowsiness. He had no history of ill contacts, recent travel, or unusual animal exposures. On presentation to the emergency department, he was treated empirically for meningococcemia, and laboratory investigation including blood cultures and a lumbar puncture were performed. S moniliformis, the agent of rat bite fever and Haverhill fever was isolated from blood cultures, and the patient eventually recovered after being treated with intravenous penicillin. We review the epidemiology, clinical syndromes, diagnosis, and treatment of infection due to S moniliformis. An immunosuppressed woman with systemic lupus erythematosus developed septic polyarthritis for which no bacterial etiology could be identified until specific cultures were performed that demonstrated the presence of Mycoplasma hominis that was resistant to doxycycline. Despite treatment with various antimicrobials, resolution of symptoms was achieved only when surgical debridement of the knee was completed and a series of intravenous immunoglobulin G injections were administered in addition to a 6-month course of levofloxacin. This case history illustrates the potential for fastidious bacteria such as M hominis to cause systemic illness in a susceptible host, the laboratory procedures that are necessary to detect and characterize this organism in clinical specimens, and the difficulties faced by clinicians who must provide treatment to manage compromised hosts who become infected with M hominis.', 'cite_spans': [{'start': 262, 'end': 289, 'text': 'Control, Vancouver, Canada.', 'ref_id': None}], 'ref_spans': [], 'eq_spans': [], 'section': '42', 'sec_num': None}, {'text': 'Ochrobactrum Infections Microbiology No. MB 08-7 (MB-356) Geraldine S. Hall, PhD, and Jo-Anne M. Salangsang, MD. Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH. Ochrobactrum anthropi is a nonfermentative, nonfastidious, aerobic, oxidase-positive, indole-negative, and motile gram-negative rod that is commonly found in the environment and is occasionally pathogenic in humans. It is highly resistant to Î²-lactam antibiotics except carbapenems, but pathogenicity is low. Risk factors for a clinically significant infection include the presence of foreign material, especially central venous catheters, surgery or instrumentation, chronic illness, and an immunocompromised or debilitated state. Depending on the clinical scenario, a single positive blood culture should strongly be considered a contaminant, particularly in a stable, immunocompetent host. The most common infections it causes are bacteremias and, less frequently, endophthalmitis and chronic sinusitis, as part of a polymicrobial infection. Rarely, it can cause pyogenic infections and septic shock. Patients generally have a benign clinical course with an uneventful recovery. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy includes ciprofloxacin, imipenem, and meropenem and, possibly, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and aminoglycosides. Some cases of persistent catheter-related bloodstream infections require catheter removal. Most cases involving infections with other types of foreign material require device removal.
